In our experiment, the average convergence radius r (the average radius of the last *K* vertices (*K* = 5) of all the case trajectories) for PCA reduced embeddings of cropped flow fields ( $p_i(t)$ ), is reduced by  $35.24 \\pm 0.59\\%$ , compared to those of un-cropped flow fields. The convergence radius  $r_i$  of a trajectory of case *i* is defined as:  $r_i = \\frac{1}{K} \\sum_{t=t_i-K+1}^{t_i} ||p_i(t) - \\overline{p_i}||$ , where  $\\overline{p_i} = \\frac{1}{K} \\sum_{t=t_i-K+1}^{t_i} p_i(t)$ .

It was found that the mode transition was a nonlinear and unstable process with significant Mach number fluctuations that had an adverse effect on the scramjet's stability. Kato et al. [[28](#page-11-0)] conducted an experimental investigation on the flame behavior during scram to ram transition. They have concluded that the flame fluctuated in the isolator due to the coupling between fluid dynamics and combustion and that the reversely propagating deflagration flame occurred when the thermal choke was established. In a DMSJ engine with fin-guided injection upstream of the cavity, the scram-to-ram transition was experimentally studied by Aguilera et al. [\\[29](#page-11-0)]. The findings indicated that the transition process could be characterized by a series of flame oscillations driven by hopping cycles, which included transient thermal choking, flame flashback, cavity flame-holding, and detachment. The combustion flow field in a scramjet is inherently unstable and is characterized by the presence of temporal oscillations that have an impact on the fluid flow, mixing, and heat release. Although separation-driven supersonic combustion instability has not yet received enough attention [[30](#page-11-0)], research on backpressure-induced unstable flames is very important in order to understand their physical mechanisms and impose appropriate controls.",

The 3-D vortex structures in the cavity of case 2 are found to be larger than those of case 1, primarily initiated by the shock/boundary-layer interaction in the isolator and intensified by thermal expansion in the cavity. Moreover, hairpin-like vortexes induced by the shock/boundary-layer interaction are observed on the lower wall. Both flames are confined in the vortexes that enhance fluid mixing, causing the flame in case 1 to be inside the cavity or close to the upper wall of the expansion section, while that in case 2 oscillates violently and the intermittent blowoff is observed downstream. Fig. [8](#page-7-0)(c) shows the time-averaged Mach number contours, embodying two typical features of a dual-mode scramjet. In scram mode, the flow in almost the entire combustor, except for the cavity, is supersonic. In ram mode, the subsonic region extends to the isolator and expansion section, and the supersonic channel is similar to the Laval nozzle, with a thermal throat at the cavity rear-part (*x* = 250 mm).",

Consequently, the flame is highly susceptible to the combined effects of large-scale separation vortexes and fuel jet. Even when subjected to severe shear-layer oscillations, the flame is prone to intermittent flameout [\\[9\\]](#page-11-0). In order to examine the impact of coherent structures on flame behavior under the combined action of unstable inflow and vertical jet. This work utilizes the height variation of the *T* = 1800 K isoline at *x* = 220 mm in the center slice to characterize the flame oscillation level, as shown in Fig. 13. The temporal evolution of the flame covers a maximum oscillation period (mode #3) from *t* = 3*.*05 ms to *t* = 4*.*45 ms, during which the flame exhibits the largest amplitude and almost touches the cavity floor. In mode #2 (*t* = 3*.*45 \u223c 3*.*90 ms), the flame position extends beyond the cavity step but does not reach the floor. Fig. [2](#page-4-0) provides a close-up view of mode #2, with the yellow line denoting the dominant mode (mode #1) and a frequency of approximately 8796 Hz. It is evident that the dominant mode corresponds to the self-sustained shear-layer oscillation induced by vortex shedding.",
