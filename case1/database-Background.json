The unsteadiness of the flame can be present locally or globally in supersonic combustion, for instance, reactant mixing, ignition, flame stabilization, and blow-off. Thus, unsteady supersonic combustion is an urgent problem that needs to be solved for real scramjet engine applications. This work helps to advance the knowledge of dual-mode scramjet combustion operating with different equivalence ratios by conducting quantitative analyses that characterize flame dynamics under flow separation. A hydrogenfueled direct-injection scheme was computed using *blastFoam* code via large-eddy simulation of a scramjet test rig at a stagnation temperature of 950 K and a pressure of 0.82 MPa. The computational results were in good agreement with the experimental data, and two typical flame structures (cavity shear-layer and cavity assisted jet-wake stabilized flame) corresponding to the scram/ram operating modes were reproduced. The local flame structure and flow regime were investigated using a modified flame index and filter functions. A particular focus was set on the continuous flame flashback during mode transition, which could be divided into three stages involving jet/shear-layer interaction, unsteady heat release, and the establishment of a large-area separation zone, with the decay of the cavity recirculation zone. Additionally, the unsteady jet-wake ram combustion presented three oscillation modes, giving rise to intermittent flameout of varying levels. The coherent-structures motion caused by the combined effects of low-speed separated flow and the fuel-jet was the main cause for this kind of unsteady combustion."

[\\[5](#page-11-0)] experimentally studied the combustion mode in a hydrogenfueled direct-injection scramjet and found that the transition threshold equivalence ratio (*ER*) was 0.23 under Mach 4 flight conditions. Zhang et al. [\\[6\\]](#page-11-0) investigated the transition process via an experiment with a continuous increase in equivalence ratio, and concluded that the large equivalence ratio slope would not lead to slope variation of pressure rising even at high Mach numbers. The mode transition process in a strut-based combustor with a combined injection strategy was numerically explored by Huang et al. [\\[7](#page-11-0)], and it was reported that the airflow conditions and the jet to crossflow pressure ratio both had a large impact except the injection strategy. By varying the injection pressure, Yan et al. [\\[8\\]](#page-11-0) compared the transition processes from scram to ram and from ram to scram. The results revealed that the transition from ram to scram was more challenging than from scram to ram, and the shock waves were still in the isolator when the combustor entered scram mode. Also, a lot of effort has been put into studying the mechanisms that stabilize combustion [\\[5,9](#page-11-0)–[11\\]](#page-11-0).

The paper is structured as follows: The next section describes the methodology and quantitative comparison. After that a phenomenological description of flame stabilization mechanism is presented following a comprehensive analysis of the optical and numerical images. Then, the combustion and flow regimes are vividly demonstrated. Subsequently, the temporal evolution of dynamic behaviors, including mode transition and oscillating flame, is characterized to reveal the potential control mechanism. Finally, some significant conclusions are drawn."

Further topologically identical coarser (1.0 million) and finer (7.0 million) grids are generated for case 1 in order to do a grid independence study. The pressure distributions on the upper wall are shown to be nearly identical apart from the leading edge of the expansion section, where the moderate and finer grids predict lower values than the coarser one, which is consistent with what was seen in Cao's investigations [\\[11](#page-11-0)]. This might be due to local refinement capturing multiscale turbulence at the expansion fan. The simulations for both cases are conducted on the moderate grid (5.0 million) in order to make a compromise between the fidelity and efficiency. As can be seen in Fig. [3,](#page-4-0) the pressure distribution on the upper wall matches the experimental results well for both cases except the separation point pressure in the isolator for case 2, which is slightly overpredicted. The absence of good near-wall resolution might be the most important factor among the other factors explaining the overprediction. In addition, a sharp pressure drop can also be observed owing to the rapid expansion of a high-pressure jet near the inlet, but it is not captured by the discrete pressure measurements. Anyway, these discrepancies are all acceptable."

Building upon previous studies by Yuan et al. [\\[10](#page-11-0)], it is found that during scram mode, the fuel jet splits the cavity into two distinct regions: a rich-premixed zone and a hot product zone. The resulting flame in the cavity is discontinuous and is stabilized within the shear layers of recirculation zones. The shear layer and fuel jet impede supersonic inflow, creating reflected shocks and a bow shock. On the other hand, during ram mode operation, the flame is stabilized in the jet-wake. Furthermore, the corner recirculation zone plays a vital role in maintaining continuous ignition of the fuel jet. Although there is no primary recirculation zone within the cavity, the hot products that flow downstream have positive effects on the jet-wake flame. This is because pure jet-wake stabilized combustion is not attainable under low inflow stagnation temperatures [\\[9\\]](#page-11-0). Additionally, the shear layer and shock train exhibit violent oscillations due to large-scale vortex shedding. As a result, the flow field is complex and intrinsically unstable."

However, the large scale and high dimensionality of simulation-generated temporal flow field data present significant challenges for visual interpretation, feature differentiation, and cross-case comparison. In this paper, we present TemporalFlowViz, a parameter-aware visual analytics workflow and system designed to support expert-driven clustering, visualization, and interpretation of temporal flow fields from scramjet combustion simulations. Our approach leverages hundreds of simulated combustion cases with varying initial conditions, each producing time-sequenced flow field images. We use pretrained Vision Transformers to extract high-dimensional embeddings from these frames, apply dimensionality reduction and density-based clustering to uncover latent combustion modes, and construct temporal trajectories in the embedding space to track the evolution of each simulation over time. To bridge the gap between latent representations and expert reasoning, domain specialists annotate representative cluster centroids with descriptive labels. These annotations are used as contextual prompts for a vision–language model, which generates natural-language summaries for individual frames and full simulation cases. The system also supports parameter-based filtering, similarity-based case retrieval, and coordinated multi-view exploration to facilitate in-depth analysis. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TemporalFlowViz through two expert-informed case studies and expert feedback, showing TemporalFlowViz enhances hypothesis generation, supports interpretable pattern discovery, and enhances knowledge discovery in large-scale scramjet combustion analysis."

The advent of deep convolutional neural networks marked a paradigm shift: AlexNet demonstrates that end-toend learning of hierarchical features yields superior performance on large-scale image classification [\\[15\\]](#page-9-16), while ResNet introduces residual connections to facilitate training of very deep architectures [\\[12\\]](#page-9-17). Unsupervised methods, such as stacked denoising autoencoders, learn compact representations by reconstructing corrupted inputs and have been applied successfully to clustering and anomaly detection [\\[26\\]](#page-9-18). More recently, Vision Transformers model images as sequences of patch embeddings, leveraging self-attention to capture long-range dependencies and achieve state-of-the-art results on various benchmarks [\\[8\\]](#page-9-2). These advances form the foundation for representing complex flow-field imagery in scramjet combustion analysis."

Among these, the pressure field and OH field were identified by domain experts as particularly important for combustion interpretation. The pressure field reflects global flow evolution and the onset of steady or oscillatory combustion states, while the OH field indicates local combustion activity and flame structure. Each physical field's VTK data is then processed by a python program to map into an image under a uniform colormap and cropped out of excessive background regions to generate a clean visual representation of flow field inside engine."

TemporalFlowViz combines ViT embeddings, interactive trajectory construction, density-based clustering, and expertaugmented semantic summarization to support interpretable analysis of high-dimensional, time-sequenced combustion data. By allowing experts to annotate representative cluster centroids, which then condition a vision–language model for generating frame- and case-level descriptions, we establish a reusable semantic layer that transforms complex flow field patterns into interpretable textual narratives. This multimodal annotation pipeline enables automated reporting, similarity-driven retrieval, and collaborative analysis with minimal manual overhead. We demonstrated the utility of TemporalFlowViz through two expert-driven case studies focusing on pressure and OH field dynamics. These studies revealed the system's ability to distinguish combustion modes, uncover evolution patterns, and support scalable interpretation across parameterized simulations. Expert feedback confirmed that the system accelerates hypothesis validation, reduces cognitive load, and facilitates knowledge sharing across teams. In summary, TemporalFlowViz represents a step toward deeply integrated, expert-informed visual analytics for scientific simulations—fusing deep learning, trajectorybased reasoning, and semantic interpretability into a unified framework for understanding combustion dynamics at scale."
