The unsteadiness of the flame can be present locally or globally in supersonic combustion, for instance, reactant mixing, ignition, flame stabilization, and blow-off. Thus, unsteady supersonic combustion is an urgent problem that needs to be solved for real scramjet engine applications. This work helps to advance the knowledge of dual-mode scramjet combustion operating with different equivalence ratios by conducting quantitative analyses that characterize flame dynamics under flow separation. A hydrogenfueled direct-injection scheme was computed using *blastFoam* code via large-eddy simulation of a scramjet test rig at a stagnation temperature of 950 K and a pressure of 0.82 MPa. The computational results were in good agreement with the experimental data, and two typical flame structures (cavity shear-layer and cavity assisted jet-wake stabilized flame) corresponding to the scram/ram operating modes were reproduced. The local flame structure and flow regime were investigated using a modified flame index and filter functions. A particular focus was set on the continuous flame flashback during mode transition, which could be divided into three stages involving jet/shear-layer interaction, unsteady heat release, and the establishment of a large-area separation zone, with the decay of the cavity recirculation zone. Additionally, the unsteady jet-wake ram combustion presented three oscillation modes, giving rise to intermittent flameout of varying levels. The coherent-structures motion caused by the combined effects of low-speed separated flow and the fuel-jet was the main cause for this kind of unsteady combustion."

Further topologically identical coarser (1.0 million) and finer (7.0 million) grids are generated for case 1 in order to do a grid independence study. The pressure distributions on the upper wall are shown to be nearly identical apart from the leading edge of the expansion section, where the moderate and finer grids predict lower values than the coarser one, which is consistent with what was seen in Cao's investigations [\\[11](#page-11-0)]. This might be due to local refinement capturing multiscale turbulence at the expansion fan. The simulations for both cases are conducted on the moderate grid (5.0 million) in order to make a compromise between the fidelity and efficiency. As can be seen in Fig. [3,](#page-4-0) the pressure distribution on the upper wall matches the experimental results well for both cases except the separation point pressure in the isolator for case 2, which is slightly overpredicted. The absence of good near-wall resolution might be the most important factor among the other factors explaining the overprediction. In addition, a sharp pressure drop can also be observed owing to the rapid expansion of a high-pressure jet near the inlet, but it is not captured by the discrete pressure measurements. Anyway, these discrepancies are all acceptable."

The fuel-jet core in case 1 has a branch due to the strong entrainment, and a significant amount of hydrogen collects in the corner to maintain the upstream flame's fuel supply. The downstream flame receives radicals and a hot environment from the cavity recirculation zone, which is located at the rear of the shear-layer. This process is known as cavity shear-layer stabilized combustion. The cold jet penetrates the shear-layer and causes local extinction, in contrast to the outcomes of injection upstream of the cavity [\\[9\\]](#page-11-0). But the whole flame remains stable, since it is mainly held by the vortex interactions with the cavity rather than the streamwise transportation. In case 2, a significant corner recirculation zone is also generated. Nevertheless, its jet momentum is higher and the recirculation velocity is lower than in case 1. In order to prevent hydrogen from being heavily entrained into the corner, hot products collect instead, acting as an ignitor. It is important to note that the cavity lacks a primary recirculation zone, which may be the result of interactions between the fuel jet and low-speed separated flow in a configuration with a large length to depth ratio (L/D = 11). Similarly, it can be inferred as cavity assisted jet-wake stabilized combustion, though it is susceptible to the flow oscillation."

Notably, the pressure waveform measured in the cavity (P1) exhibits a high-frequency oscillation, which can be attributed to the acoustic motion in the subsonic region [\\[22\\]](#page-11-0). Additionally, the pressure response recorded in the tail of the isolator (P2) depicts the upstream propagation of backpressure. Based on the severity of the flame flashback, the entire process can be categorized into three stages. In stage #1, the pressure in the cavity rapidly increases with an increase in injection pressure. Although a weak backpressure is observed in the isolator, a severe flashback phenomenon is observed, which is also evident in the early stage of Fig. 10. This phenomenon is mainly associated with the sudden disturbance of the jet to shear-layer under stronger penetrability. In stage #2, the pressure tendency in the cavity remains relatively stable, and the combustor is in a state of energy accumulation by heat-release. The propagation abilities of backpressure and flame flashback are both weak, while the frequency is notably higher due to unsteady heat-release. In the critical stage of mode transition (stage #3), long-term and large-amplitude pressure responses can be detected in the isolator, indicating the establishment of a large-area separation zone. Furthermore, multiple reciprocating oscillations of the separated flow and continuous severe flame flashback phenomenon can be observed. The obvious large-amplitude oscillation mode with a rapid-growing trend is monitored in the cavity, which is caused by the continuous pressurization and depressurization cycles. It can be inferred that the transient thermal choking occurs in this stage, and the intensive heat-release plays a significant role in promoting the mode transition in this stage."

In order to examine the impact of coherent structures on flame behavior under the combined action of unstable inflow and vertical jet. This work utilizes the height variation of the *T* = 1800 K isoline at *x* = 220 mm in the center slice to characterize the flame oscillation level, as shown in Fig. 13. The temporal evolution of the flame covers a maximum oscillation period (mode #3) from *t* = 3*.*05 ms to *t* = 4*.*45 ms, during which the flame exhibits the largest amplitude and almost touches the cavity floor. In mode #2 (*t* = 3*.*45 ∼ 3*.*90 ms), the flame position extends beyond the cavity step but does not reach the floor. Fig. [2](#page-4-0) provides a close-up view of mode #2, with the yellow line denoting the dominant mode (mode #1) and a frequency of approximately 8796 Hz.

It is convincing that the most energetic POM (mode #1) is in close proximity to the dominant flame mode. Similar consistency is also observed in the lower-frequency modes. The spatial structures of the first three POMs are depicted in Fig. 15(b). In mode #1, the rapid exchange of momentum generates a pair of counter-rotating vortices when the high-speed jet penetrates the low-speed separated flow. The upstream vortex, which directly interacts with the fuel jet, explains the periodic variation in the penetration depth of the jet, while the downstream vortex determines the oscillation characteristics of the flame. In mode #2, a similar but larger counter-rotating vortex pair is generated, and the upstream vortex extends to the tail of the isolator. Mode #3 embodies the coherent structures that are related to the largest-amplitude flame oscillation. A single large vortex can be observed at the cavity exit, which occupies the entire height and entrains the flame into the cavity floor, consistent with the previous analyses. The vortex is generated by the sudden contraction of the channel when entering the expansion section. Therefore, it is expected that low-frequency oscillations of this kind can be suppressed by optimizing the dimensional parameters of the combustor."

In contrast, Gemma-3 offers lightweight 4-bit and 8-bit quantizations and efficient image-to-text generation speed. It successfully processes multiple images in a single pass without out-ofmemory failures, making it more suitable for our batch-oriented visual analytics workflow.

    "paragraph_info": "Interestingly, E4 also observed that even after the pressure field of a simulation reaches a steady state, the OH field trajectory may continue to fluctuate within a relatively wide region of the embedding space. However, these fluctuations consistently remain within the same cluster. This suggested that while the flame shape exhibited spatial variability, the underlying combustion mode remained stable. This behavior reflected the system's ability to distinguish transient structural changes from actual combustion mode transitions—enabling robust combustion classification despite internal oscillations."

    "paragraph_info": "In this paper, we presented TemporalFlowViz, a visual analytics workflow and system for expert-guided exploration, clustering, and interpretation of temporal flow-field data from scramjet combustion simulations. TemporalFlowViz combines ViT embeddings, interactive trajectory construction, density-based clustering, and expertaugmented semantic summarization to support interpretable analysis of high-dimensional, time-sequenced combustion data. By allowing experts to annotate representative cluster centroids, which then condition a vision–language model for generating frame- and case-level descriptions, we establish a reusable semantic layer that transforms complex flow field patterns into interpretable textual narratives. This multimodal annotation pipeline enables automated reporting, similarity-driven retrieval, and collaborative analysis with minimal manual overhead. We demonstrated the utility of TemporalFlowViz through two expert-driven case studies focusing on pressure and OH field dynamics. These studies revealed the system's ability to distinguish combustion modes, uncover evolution patterns, and support scalable interpretation across parameterized simulations. Expert feedback confirmed that the system accelerates hypothesis validation, reduces cognitive load, and facilitates knowledge sharing across teams. In summary, TemporalFlowViz represents a step toward deeply integrated, expert-informed visual analytics for scientific simulations—fusing deep learning, trajectorybased reasoning, and semantic interpretability into a unified framework for understanding combustion dynamics at scale."
