    "paragraph_info": "The combustion process in the scramjet engines generally takes place in unsteady conditions. The unsteadiness of the flame can be present locally or globally in supersonic combustion, for instance, reactant mixing, ignition, flame stabilization, and blow-off. Thus, unsteady supersonic combustion is an urgent problem that needs to be solved for real scramjet engine applications. This work helps to advance the knowledge of dual-mode scramjet combustion operating with different equivalence ratios by conducting quantitative analyses that characterize flame dynamics under flow separation. A hydrogenfueled direct-injection scheme was computed using *blastFoam* code via large-eddy simulation of a scramjet test rig at a stagnation temperature of 950 K and a pressure of 0.82 MPa. The computational results were in good agreement with the experimental data, and two typical flame structures (cavity shear-layer and cavity assisted jet-wake stabilized flame) corresponding to the scram/ram operating modes were reproduced. The local flame structure and flow regime were investigated using a modified flame index and filter functions. A particular focus was set on the continuous flame flashback during mode transition, which could be divided into three stages involving jet/shear-layer interaction, unsteady heat release, and the establishment of a large-area separation zone, with the decay of the cavity recirculation zone. Additionally, the unsteady jet-wake ram combustion presented three oscillation modes, giving rise to intermittent flameout of varying levels. The coherent-structures motion caused by the combined effects of low-speed separated flow and the fuel-jet was the main cause for this kind of unsteady combustion."

The correlation between operating and stabilization modes of the DMSJ combustor was further investigated by Yuan et al. [\\[10\\]](#page-11-0), who observed that the flame was stabilized in the cavity shear-layer at scram mode while in the jet-wake at ram mode."

    "paragraph_info": "Combustion mode transition is usually accompanied by the transient establishment of flow separation. The combustion instabilities associated with mode transition are typically more intense and severe due to the tendency toward cavity flame blowout [[21\\]](#page-11-0). Yang et al. [[27](#page-11-0)] provided a mechanical model of the DMSJ engine to analyze the mode transition mechanisms. It was found that the mode transition was a nonlinear and unstable process with significant Mach number fluctuations that had an adverse effect on the scramjet's stability. Kato et al. [[28](#page-11-0)] conducted an experimental investigation on the flame behavior during scram to ram transition. They have concluded that the flame fluctuated in the isolator due to the coupling between fluid dynamics and combustion and that the reversely propagating deflagration flame occurred when the thermal choke was established. In a DMSJ engine with fin-guided injection upstream of the cavity, the scram-to-ram transition was experimentally studied by Aguilera et al. [\\[29](#page-11-0)]. The findings indicated that the transition process could be characterized by a series of flame oscillations driven by hopping cycles, which included transient thermal choking, flame flashback, cavity flame-holding, and detachment. The combustion flow field in a scramjet is inherently unstable and is characterized by the presence of temporal oscillations that have an impact on the fluid flow, mixing, and heat release. Although separation-driven supersonic combustion instability has not yet received enough attention [[30](#page-11-0)], research on backpressure-induced unstable flames is very important in order to understand their physical mechanisms and impose appropriate controls."

Additionally, the pressure response recorded in the tail of the isolator (P2) depicts the upstream propagation of backpressure.

In stage #1, the pressure in the cavity rapidly increases with an increase in injection pressure. Although a weak backpressure is observed in the isolator, a severe flashback phenomenon is observed, which is also evident in the early stage of Fig. 10. This phenomenon is mainly associated with the sudden disturbance of the jet to shear-layer under stronger penetrability. In stage #2, the pressure tendency in the cavity remains relatively stable, and the combustor is in a state of energy accumulation by heat-release. The propagation abilities of backpressure and flame flashback are both weak, while the frequency is notably higher due to unsteady heat-release. In the critical stage of mode transition (stage #3), long-term and large-amplitude pressure responses can be detected in the isolator, indicating the establishment of a large-area separation zone. Furthermore, multiple reciprocating oscillations of the separated flow and continuous severe flame flashback phenomenon can be observed. The obvious large-amplitude oscillation mode with a rapid-growing trend is monitored in the cavity, which is caused by the continuous pressurization and depressurization cycles. It can be inferred that the transient thermal choking occurs in this stage, and the intensive heat-release plays a significant role in promoting the mode transition in this stage."

The temporal evolution of the flame covers a maximum oscillation period (mode #3) from *t* = 3*.*05 ms to *t* = 4*.*45 ms, during which the flame exhibits the largest amplitude and almost touches the cavity floor. In mode #2 (*t* = 3*.*45 ∼ 3*.*90 ms), the flame position extends beyond the cavity step but does not reach the floor. Fig. [2](#page-4-0) provides a close-up view of mode #2, with the yellow line denoting the dominant mode (mode #1) and a frequency of approximately 8796 Hz.

In mode #1, the rapid exchange of momentum generates a pair of counter-rotating vortices when the high-speed jet penetrates the low-speed separated flow. The upstream vortex, which directly interacts with the fuel jet, explains the periodic variation in the penetration depth of the jet, while the downstream vortex determines the oscillation characteristics of the flame. In mode #2, a similar but larger counter-rotating vortex pair is generated, and the upstream vortex extends to the tail of the isolator. Mode #3 embodies the coherent structures that are related to the largest-amplitude flame oscillation. A single large vortex can be observed at the cavity exit, which occupies the entire height and entrains the flame into the cavity floor, consistent with the previous analyses. The vortex is generated by the sudden contraction of the channel when entering the expansion section. Therefore, it is expected that low-frequency oscillations of this kind can be suppressed by optimizing the dimensional parameters of the combustor."

At the frame level, the workflow produces direct semantic interpretations based on nearby cluster exemplars.

However, these fluctuations consistently remain within the same cluster. This suggested that while the flame shape exhibited spatial variability, the underlying combustion mode remained stable. This behavior reflected the system's ability to distinguish transient structural changes from actual combustion mode transitions—enabling robust combustion classification despite internal oscillations."

    "paragraph_info": "In this paper, we presented TemporalFlowViz, a visual analytics workflow and system for expert-guided exploration, clustering, and interpretation of temporal flow-field data from scramjet combustion simulations. TemporalFlowViz combines ViT embeddings, interactive trajectory construction, density-based clustering, and expertaugmented semantic summarization to support interpretable analysis of high-dimensional, time-sequenced combustion data. By allowing experts to annotate representative cluster centroids, which then condition a vision–language model for generating frame- and case-level descriptions, we establish a reusable semantic layer that transforms complex flow field patterns into interpretable textual narratives. This multimodal annotation pipeline enables automated reporting, similarity-driven retrieval, and collaborative analysis with minimal manual overhead. We demonstrated the utility of TemporalFlowViz through two expert-driven case studies focusing on pressure and OH field dynamics. These studies revealed the system's ability to distinguish combustion modes, uncover evolution patterns, and support scalable interpretation across parameterized simulations. Expert feedback confirmed that the system accelerates hypothesis validation, reduces cognitive load, and facilitates knowledge sharing across teams. In summary, TemporalFlowViz represents a step toward deeply integrated, expert-informed visual analytics for scientific simulations—fusing deep learning, trajectorybased reasoning, and semantic interpretability into a unified framework for understanding combustion dynamics at scale."
