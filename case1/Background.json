However, the large scale and high dimensionality of simulation-generated temporal flow field data present significant challenges for visual interpretation, feature differentiation, and cross-case comparison. In this paper, we present TemporalFlowViz, a parameter-aware visual analytics workflow and system designed to support expert-driven clustering, visualization, and interpretation of temporal flow fields from scramjet combustion simulations. Our approach leverages hundreds of simulated combustion cases with varying initial conditions, each producing time-sequenced flow field images. We use pretrained Vision Transformers to extract high-dimensional embeddings from these frames, apply dimensionality reduction and density-based clustering to uncover latent combustion modes, and construct temporal trajectories in the embedding space to track the evolution of each simulation over time. To bridge the gap between latent representations and expert reasoning, domain specialists annotate representative cluster centroids with descriptive labels. These annotations are used as contextual prompts for a vision\u2013language model, which generates natural-language summaries for individual frames and full simulation cases. The system also supports parameter-based filtering, similarity-based case retrieval, and coordinated multi-view exploration to facilitate in-depth analysis. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TemporalFlowViz through two expert-informed case studies and expert feedback, showing TemporalFlowViz enhances hypothesis generation, supports interpretable pattern discovery, and enhances knowledge discovery in large-scale scramjet combustion analysis.",

In a DMSJ engine, intensive heat release will alter the inflow conditions through the large-scale flow separation induced by upstream-propagating backpressure, which in turn modulates the flame stability downstream [\\[23\\]](#page-11-0). The possible interaction with fuel jets complicates the instability process even more. According to a series of well-known studies [\\[5,9,24,25\\]](#page-11-0), once the heat release reached a high enough level, there was a noticeable unsteadiness. Wang et al. [\\[26\\]](#page-11-0) experimentally studied the oscillation features of shock-train structures in an isolator with a choked throat, and found that the shock-train oscillation could propagate further downstream along the thicker boundary layer, resulting in drastic coherence and pressure fluctuations in downstream separated flow. Fotia et al. [\\[18](#page-11-0)] carried out an experimental study on the hydrogen-fueled DMSJ engine and observed some low-frequency periodic oscillations of the flame position under the separated flow, which could be correlated with the upstream unsteady pre-combustion shock-train.",

This model treats each gird cell as having two parts: the fine structure, which is dominated by chemical reaction, and the surrounding one, which is dominated by turbulent mixing. As a result, the nonlinear reaction rate can be estimated by weighting the laminar finite-rate chemistry with the volume fraction of fine structure. where the laminar reaction rate *\u03c9*\u02d9 *<sup>k</sup>* is calculated using filtered quantities based on the Arrhenius formula. Marinov's intricate hydrogen-air reaction mechanism [[38](#page-11-0)] with 9 species and 27 elementary reactions is adopted here in order to reproduce the practical chemical kinetics of the dynamic combustion process. This mechanism has been justified in previous publications for supersonic combustion [[39](#page-11-0),[40](#page-11-0)]. The volume fraction of fine structure *\u03ba* can be defined as a function of chemical time-scale *\u03c4<sup>c</sup>* and SGS mixing time-scale *\u03c4m*, i.e. *\u03ba* = *\u03c4c/ (\u03c4<sup>c</sup>* + *\u03c4m)*.",

The downstream flame receives radicals and a hot environment from the cavity recirculation zone, which is located at the rear of the shear-layer. This process is known as cavity shear-layer stabilized combustion. The cold jet penetrates the shear-layer and causes local extinction, in contrast to the outcomes of injection upstream of the cavity [\\[9\\]](#page-11-0). But the whole flame remains stable, since it is mainly held by the vortex interactions with the cavity rather than the streamwise transportation. In case 2, a significant corner recirculation zone is also generated. Nevertheless, its jet momentum is higher and the recirculation velocity is lower than in case 1. In order to prevent hydrogen from being heavily entrained into the corner, hot products collect instead, acting as an ignitor. It is important to note that the cavity lacks a primary recirculation zone, which may be the result of interactions between the fuel jet and low-speed separated flow in a configuration with a large length to depth ratio (L/D = 11). Similarly, it can be inferred as cavity assisted jet-wake stabilized combustion, though it is susceptible to the flow oscillation.",

In the last one, the intensive heat-release promoted the establishment of a large-area separation zone, which led to the oscillation of combustion mode followed by the complete transition. In addition, the unsteady jet-wake ram combustion presented three oscillation modes. The presence of a counter-rotating vortex pair in the front part of the cavity (10476 Hz and 2381 Hz), and a single large-scale vortex at the cavity exit (476 Hz) sustained the large-amplitude shear-layer oscillations, which gave rise to the periodic disintegration of the fuel jet, as well as intermittent flameout further downstream.",
