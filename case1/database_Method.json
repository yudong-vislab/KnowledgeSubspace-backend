The unsteadiness of the flame can be present locally or globally in supersonic combustion, for instance, reactant mixing, ignition, flame stabilization, and blow-off. Thus, unsteady supersonic combustion is an urgent problem that needs to be solved for real scramjet engine applications. This work helps to advance the knowledge of dual-mode scramjet combustion operating with different equivalence ratios by conducting quantitative analyses that characterize flame dynamics under flow separation. A hydrogenfueled direct-injection scheme was computed using *blastFoam* code via large-eddy simulation of a scramjet test rig at a stagnation temperature of 950 K and a pressure of 0.82 MPa. The computational results were in good agreement with the experimental data, and two typical flame structures (cavity shear-layer and cavity assisted jet-wake stabilized flame) corresponding to the scram/ram operating modes were reproduced. The local flame structure and flow regime were investigated using a modified flame index and filter functions. A particular focus was set on the continuous flame flashback during mode transition, which could be divided into three stages involving jet/shear-layer interaction, unsteady heat release, and the establishment of a large-area separation zone, with the decay of the cavity recirculation zone. Additionally, the unsteady jet-wake ram combustion presented three oscillation modes, giving rise to intermittent flameout of varying levels. The coherent-structures motion caused by the combined effects of low-speed separated flow and the fuel-jet was the main cause for this kind of unsteady combustion."

Therein, the flow instabilities may be attributed to the self-sustained cavity shear-layer oscillation [[19\\]](#page-11-0), unsteady jets in supersonic crossflow [[20](#page-11-0)], and separated boundary layers [\\[21\\]](#page-11-0). Wang et al. [\\[19](#page-11-0)] have numerically found two flowrelated combustion oscillation mechanisms in the scramjet with hydrogen injected upstream of the cavity. One was the intermittent auto-ignition of mixture packets linked to the fuel jet, and the other was the unsteady flame propagation affected by the jet/cavity shear-layer interaction. In the simulation of a cavityfloor direct-injection scramjet, Sitaraman et al. [\\[22](#page-11-0)] also noticed low-frequency heat release and pressure oscillations and attributed them to the periodic fluctuation of jet penetration brought on by the interaction with the shear layer. In a DMSJ engine, intensive heat release will alter the inflow conditions through the large-scale flow separation induced by upstream-propagating backpressure, which in turn modulates the flame stability downstream [\\[23\\]](#page-11-0). The possible interaction with fuel jets complicates the instability process even more. According to a series of well-known studies [\\[5,9,24,25\\]](#page-11-0), once the heat release reached a high enough level, there was a noticeable unsteadiness. Wang et al. [\\[26\\]](#page-11-0) experimentally studied the oscillation features of shock-train structures in an isolator with a choked throat, and found that the shock-train oscillation could propagate further downstream along the thicker boundary layer, resulting in drastic coherence and pressure fluctuations in downstream separated flow. Fotia et al. [\\[18](#page-11-0)] carried out an experimental study on the hydrogen-fueled DMSJ engine and observed some low-frequency periodic oscillations of the flame position under the separated flow, which could be correlated with the upstream unsteady pre-combustion shock-train."

The 3-D vortex structures in the cavity of case 2 are found to be larger than those of case 1, primarily initiated by the shock/boundary-layer interaction in the isolator and intensified by thermal expansion in the cavity. Moreover, hairpin-like vortexes induced by the shock/boundary-layer interaction are observed on the lower wall. Both flames are confined in the vortexes that enhance fluid mixing, causing the flame in case 1 to be inside the cavity or close to the upper wall of the expansion section, while that in case 2 oscillates violently and the intermittent blowoff is observed downstream. Fig. [8](#page-7-0)(c) shows the time-averaged Mach number contours, embodying two typical features of a dual-mode scramjet. In scram mode, the flow in almost the entire combustor, except for the cavity, is supersonic.

Notably, the pressure waveform measured in the cavity (P1) exhibits a high-frequency oscillation, which can be attributed to the acoustic motion in the subsonic region [\\[22\\]](#page-11-0). Additionally, the pressure response recorded in the tail of the isolator (P2) depicts the upstream propagation of backpressure. Based on the severity of the flame flashback, the entire process can be categorized into three stages. In stage #1, the pressure in the cavity rapidly increases with an increase in injection pressure. Although a weak backpressure is observed in the isolator, a severe flashback phenomenon is observed, which is also evident in the early stage of Fig. 10. This phenomenon is mainly associated with the sudden disturbance of the jet to shear-layer under stronger penetrability. In stage #2, the pressure tendency in the cavity remains relatively stable, and the combustor is in a state of energy accumulation by heat-release. The propagation abilities of backpressure and flame flashback are both weak, while the frequency is notably higher due to unsteady heat-release. In the critical stage of mode transition (stage #3), long-term and large-amplitude pressure responses can be detected in the isolator, indicating the establishment of a large-area separation zone. Furthermore, multiple reciprocating oscillations of the separated flow and continuous severe flame flashback phenomenon can be observed. The obvious large-amplitude oscillation mode with a rapid-growing trend is monitored in the cavity, which is caused by the continuous pressurization and depressurization cycles. It can be inferred that the transient thermal choking occurs in this stage, and the intensive heat-release plays a significant role in promoting the mode transition in this stage."

In this paper, we present TemporalFlowViz, a parameter-aware visual analytics workflow and system designed to support expert-driven clustering, visualization, and interpretation of temporal flow fields from scramjet combustion simulations. Our approach leverages hundreds of simulated combustion cases with varying initial conditions, each producing time-sequenced flow field images. We use pretrained Vision Transformers to extract high-dimensional embeddings from these frames, apply dimensionality reduction and density-based clustering to uncover latent combustion modes, and construct temporal trajectories in the embedding space to track the evolution of each simulation over time. To bridge the gap between latent representations and expert reasoning, domain specialists annotate representative cluster centroids with descriptive labels. These annotations are used as contextual prompts for a vision–language model, which generates natural-language summaries for individual frames and full simulation cases. The system also supports parameter-based filtering, similarity-based case retrieval, and coordinated multi-view exploration to facilitate in-depth analysis. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TemporalFlowViz through two expert-informed case studies and expert feedback, showing TemporalFlowViz enhances hypothesis generation, supports interpretable pattern discovery, and enhances knowledge discovery in large-scale scramjet combustion analysis."

However, the large scale and high dimensionality of simulation-generated temporal flow field data present significant challenges for visual interpretation, feature differentiation, and cross-case comparison. In this paper, we present TemporalFlowViz, a parameter-aware visual analytics workflow and system designed to support expert-driven clustering, visualization, and interpretation of temporal flow fields from scramjet combustion simulations. Our approach leverages hundreds of simulated combustion cases with varying initial conditions, each producing time-sequenced flow field images. We use pretrained Vision Transformers to extract high-dimensional embeddings from these frames, apply dimensionality reduction and density-based clustering to uncover latent combustion modes, and construct temporal trajectories in the embedding space to track the evolution of each simulation over time. To bridge the gap between latent representations and expert reasoning, domain specialists annotate representative cluster centroids with descriptive labels. These annotations are used as contextual prompts for a vision–language model, which generates natural-language summaries for individual frames and full simulation cases. The system also supports parameter-based filtering, similarity-based case retrieval, and coordinated multi-view exploration to facilitate in-depth analysis. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TemporalFlowViz through two expert-informed case studies and expert feedback, showing TemporalFlowViz enhances hypothesis generation, supports interpretable pattern discovery, and enhances knowledge discovery in large-scale scramjet combustion analysis."
