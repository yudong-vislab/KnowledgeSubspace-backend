    "paragraph_info": "The combustion process in the scramjet engines generally takes place in unsteady conditions. The unsteadiness of the flame can be present locally or globally in supersonic combustion, for instance, reactant mixing, ignition, flame stabilization, and blow-off. Thus, unsteady supersonic combustion is an urgent problem that needs to be solved for real scramjet engine applications. This work helps to advance the knowledge of dual-mode scramjet combustion operating with different equivalence ratios by conducting quantitative analyses that characterize flame dynamics under flow separation. A hydrogenfueled direct-injection scheme was computed using *blastFoam* code via large-eddy simulation of a scramjet test rig at a stagnation temperature of 950 K and a pressure of 0.82 MPa. The computational results were in good agreement with the experimental data, and two typical flame structures (cavity shear-layer and cavity assisted jet-wake stabilized flame) corresponding to the scram/ram operating modes were reproduced. The local flame structure and flow regime were investigated using a modified flame index and filter functions. A particular focus was set on the continuous flame flashback during mode transition, which could be divided into three stages involving jet/shear-layer interaction, unsteady heat release, and the establishment of a large-area separation zone, with the decay of the cavity recirculation zone. Additionally, the unsteady jet-wake ram combustion presented three oscillation modes, giving rise to intermittent flameout of varying levels. The coherent-structures motion caused by the combined effects of low-speed separated flow and the fuel-jet was the main cause for this kind of unsteady combustion."

    "paragraph_info": "Although a significant amount of research has been done on scramjet investigations using a variety of configurations and injection schemes [\\[12â€“14](#page-11-0)], most publications currently in print concentrate on the quasi-steady state that represents stable flame, while limited research is available on the dynamic processes that represent unstable flame, such as ignition dynamics [\\[15](#page-11-0)], thermalacoustic oscillation [\\[16\\]](#page-11-0), flame flashback [[17](#page-11-0)], and flow-induced unstable flame [[18](#page-11-0)]. Therein, the flow instabilities may be attributed to the self-sustained cavity shear-layer oscillation [[19\\]](#page-11-0), unsteady jets in supersonic crossflow [[20](#page-11-0)], and separated boundary layers [\\[21\\]](#page-11-0). Wang et al. [\\[19](#page-11-0)] have numerically found two flowrelated combustion oscillation mechanisms in the scramjet with hydrogen injected upstream of the cavity. One was the intermittent auto-ignition of mixture packets linked to the fuel jet, and the other was the unsteady flame propagation affected by the jet/cavity shear-layer interaction. In the simulation of a cavityfloor direct-injection scramjet, Sitaraman et al. [\\[22](#page-11-0)] also noticed low-frequency heat release and pressure oscillations and attributed them to the periodic fluctuation of jet penetration brought on by the interaction with the shear layer. In a DMSJ engine, intensive heat release will alter the inflow conditions through the large-scale flow separation induced by upstream-propagating backpressure, which in turn modulates the flame stability downstream [\\[23\\]](#page-11-0). The possible interaction with fuel jets complicates the instability process even more. According to a series of well-known studies [\\[5,9,24,25\\]](#page-11-0), once the heat release reached a high enough level, there was a noticeable unsteadiness. Wang et al. [\\[26\\]](#page-11-0) experimentally studied the oscillation features of shock-train structures in an isolator with a choked throat, and found that the shock-train oscillation could propagate further downstream along the thicker boundary layer, resulting in drastic coherence and pressure fluctuations in downstream separated flow. Fotia et al. [\\[18](#page-11-0)] carried out an experimental study on the hydrogen-fueled DMSJ engine and observed some low-frequency periodic oscillations of the flame position under the separated flow, which could be correlated with the upstream unsteady pre-combustion shock-train."

In order to examine the impact of coherent structures on flame behavior under the combined action of unstable inflow and vertical jet. This work utilizes the height variation of the *T* = 1800 K isoline at *x* = 220 mm in the center slice to characterize the flame oscillation level, as shown in Fig. 13. The temporal evolution of the flame covers a maximum oscillation period (mode #3) from *t* = 3*.*05 ms to *t* = 4*.*45 ms, during which the flame exhibits the largest amplitude and almost touches the cavity floor. In mode #2 (*t* = 3*.*45 âˆ¼ 3*.*90 ms), the flame position extends beyond the cavity step but does not reach the floor. Fig. [2](#page-4-0) provides a close-up view of mode #2, with the yellow line denoting the dominant mode (mode #1) and a frequency of approximately 8796 Hz.

The spatial structures of the first three POMs are depicted in Fig. 15(b). In mode #1, the rapid exchange of momentum generates a pair of counter-rotating vortices when the high-speed jet penetrates the low-speed separated flow.

However, the large scale and high dimensionality of simulation-generated temporal flow field data present significant challenges for visual interpretation, feature differentiation, and cross-case comparison. In this paper, we present TemporalFlowViz, a parameter-aware visual analytics workflow and system designed to support expert-driven clustering, visualization, and interpretation of temporal flow fields from scramjet combustion simulations. Our approach leverages hundreds of simulated combustion cases with varying initial conditions, each producing time-sequenced flow field images. We use pretrained Vision Transformers to extract high-dimensional embeddings from these frames, apply dimensionality reduction and density-based clustering to uncover latent combustion modes, and construct temporal trajectories in the embedding space to track the evolution of each simulation over time. To bridge the gap between latent representations and expert reasoning, domain specialists annotate representative cluster centroids with descriptive labels. These annotations are used as contextual prompts for a visionâ€“language model, which generates natural-language summaries for individual frames and full simulation cases. The system also supports parameter-based filtering, similarity-based case retrieval, and coordinated multi-view exploration to facilitate in-depth analysis. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TemporalFlowViz through two expert-informed case studies and expert feedback, showing TemporalFlowViz enhances hypothesis generation, supports interpretable pattern discovery, and enhances knowledge discovery in large-scale scramjet combustion analysis."

TemporalFlowViz combines ViT embeddings, interactive trajectory construction, density-based clustering, and expertaugmented semantic summarization to support interpretable analysis of high-dimensional, time-sequenced combustion data. By allowing experts to annotate representative cluster centroids, which then condition a visionâ€“language model for generating frame- and case-level descriptions, we establish a reusable semantic layer that transforms complex flow field patterns into interpretable textual narratives. This multimodal annotation pipeline enables automated reporting, similarity-driven retrieval, and collaborative analysis with minimal manual overhead. We demonstrated the utility of TemporalFlowViz through two expert-driven case studies focusing on pressure and OH field dynamics. These studies revealed the system's ability to distinguish combustion modes, uncover evolution patterns, and support scalable interpretation across parameterized simulations. Expert feedback confirmed that the system accelerates hypothesis validation, reduces cognitive load, and facilitates knowledge sharing across teams. In summary, TemporalFlowViz represents a step toward deeply integrated, expert-informed visual analytics for scientific simulationsâ€”fusing deep learning, trajectorybased reasoning, and semantic interpretability into a unified framework for understanding combustion dynamics at scale."

This will enhance the sensitivity of embeddings to subtle physical structures such as ignition fronts and weak flame zones. Second, we aim to develop a multimodal annotation workflow powered by large visionâ€“language models to support scalable, automated labeling of scientific phenomena. This will reduce expert workload and help surface recurring knowledge patterns across large simulation corpora."
