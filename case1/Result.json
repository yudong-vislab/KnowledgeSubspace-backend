[[28](#page-11-0)] conducted an experimental investigation on the flame behavior during scram to ram transition. They have concluded that the flame fluctuated in the isolator due to the coupling between fluid dynamics and combustion and that the reversely propagating deflagration flame occurred when the thermal choke was established. In a DMSJ engine with fin-guided injection upstream of the cavity, the scram-to-ram transition was experimentally studied by Aguilera et al. [\\[29](#page-11-0)]. The findings indicated that the transition process could be characterized by a series of flame oscillations driven by hopping cycles, which included transient thermal choking, flame flashback, cavity flame-holding, and detachment. The combustion flow field in a scramjet is inherently unstable and is characterized by the presence of temporal oscillations that have an impact on the fluid flow, mixing, and heat release. Although separation-driven supersonic combustion instability has not yet received enough attention [[30](#page-11-0)], research on backpressure-induced unstable flames is very important in order to understand their physical mechanisms and impose appropriate controls.",

The fuel-jet core in case 1 has a branch due to the strong entrainment, and a significant amount of hydrogen collects in the corner to maintain the upstream flame's fuel supply. The downstream flame receives radicals and a hot environment from the cavity recirculation zone, which is located at the rear of the shear-layer. This process is known as cavity shear-layer stabilized combustion. The cold jet penetrates the shear-layer and causes local extinction, in contrast to the outcomes of injection upstream of the cavity [\\[9\\]](#page-11-0). But the whole flame remains stable, since it is mainly held by the vortex interactions with the cavity rather than the streamwise transportation. In case 2, a significant corner recirculation zone is also generated. Nevertheless, its jet momentum is higher and the recirculation velocity is lower than in case 1. In order to prevent hydrogen from being heavily entrained into the corner, hot products collect instead, acting as an ignitor. It is important to note that the cavity lacks a primary recirculation zone, which may be the result of interactions between the fuel jet and low-speed separated flow in a configuration with a large length to depth ratio (L/D = 11). Similarly, it can be inferred as cavity assisted jet-wake stabilized combustion, though it is susceptible to the flow oscillation.",

The dotted circles show the appearance of flame flashback in the early stage. Although the flame is highly wrinkled, it is still stabilized by the cavity. Snapshot \"D\" can be inferred to be at the unsteady transitional mode, where the jet-wake flame gradually forms. The flame leading edge is distorted by separated flow, and flame flashback occurs. Nevertheless, it is still possible for the flame to return to cavity mode. This oscillation phenomenon between two combustion modes is also reported in Nakaya's studies [\\[20\\]](#page-11-0), which indicate that the vortexes generated by the separated boundary layer induce a strong jet-wake flame, resulting in the transient thermal choking followed by shear-layer stabilized ram combustion. In snapshots \"E\" and \"F\", the flame leading edge is entrained into the corner recirculation zone, which is hard to maintain stable combustion under such a strong disturbance. Therefore, the combustor is at the jet-wake mode in this stage.",

        "para_info": "Fig. 15(a) presents a comparison of the frequency between POMs and flame oscillation modes, as discussed previously. It is convincing that the most energetic POM (mode #1) is in close proximity to the dominant flame mode. Similar consistency is also observed in the lower-frequency modes. The spatial structures of the first three POMs are depicted in Fig. 15(b). In mode #1, the rapid exchange of momentum generates a pair of counter-rotating vortices when the high-speed jet penetrates the low-speed separated flow. The upstream vortex, which directly interacts with the fuel jet, explains the periodic variation in the penetration depth of the jet, while the downstream vortex determines the oscillation characteristics of the flame. In mode #2, a similar but larger counter-rotating vortex pair is generated, and the upstream vortex extends to the tail of the isolator. Mode #3 embodies the coherent structures that are related to the largest-amplitude flame oscillation. A single large vortex can be observed at the cavity exit, which occupies the entire height and entrains the flame into the cavity floor, consistent with the previous analyses. The vortex is generated by the sudden contraction of the channel when entering the expansion section. Therefore, it is expected that low-frequency oscillations of this kind can be suppressed by optimizing the dimensional parameters of the combustor.",
