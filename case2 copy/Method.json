This paper presents Compass, a novel visual analytics approach for in- depth analyses of the dynamic causality in urban time series.

However, the patterns and insights derived in these studies do not imply true causality, and thus the reliability of the results is often limited in applications. Recent studies [38, 89] have investigated applying the Granger causality test to capture the causal relations among urban time series. Based on a set of urban time series, these studies attempt to extract a causal graph, where each cause- effect relation between a pair of sensors is represented with a directed edge. However, one causal graph is insufficient to characterize the dynamic causal relations among multiple urban time series due to the rapidly- changing urban environments. For example, a causal relation between two sensors detected based on their time series can disappear or even be flipped from time to time (Fig. 2a) because of certain external factors, such as the wind fields in the air pollution scenarios. Such a dynamic nature demands fine- grained causality analyses that enable analysts to gain insights into the temporal variations of causal relations in urban contexts. In addition to the limitation of granularity in the prior studies, interpreting and validating these causal relations detected by automated models also require an interactive system to integrate analysts in the urban causality analysis loop [76]."

    "paragraph_info": "This study is the result of cooperation with multiple domains. On the one hand, rapid urbanization has resulted in many notorious urban problems, such as noise [9], traffic congestion [53], and water/air pollution [46]. On the other hand, various applications have proven the utility of causal analysis in providing valuable implications. In the past six months, we collaborated closely with three experts (EA, EB and EC). EA and EB are urban computing experts who have decades of experience studying data- driven solutions for urban problems. EC is a researcher with expertise in causal analyses. We together attempt to apply causal analysis to solve the urban problems. As a statistical analysis method, causal analysis is not limited to computer scientists but can be accepted by urban practitioners with statistical knowledge."

The time series of the ego sensor is displayed first, while the time series of the neighbor sensors can be displayed on demands. The lines are colored according to the sensors. Users can specify peak- based and periodicity- based time partitioning strategies. The partitioned time windows are subsequently shown with semitransparent rectangles. Furthermore, this view also serves as a timeline for the graph view (Sec. 5.3) because these two views are juxtaposed up and down."

A causal detection framework and temporal visualizations are combined to unveil these dynamic causalities.

The static causal graphs detected by the previous methods will ignore these time- varying cause- effect relationships and thus cannot support accurate and informed decisions.

This observation supports other researchers' opinion [31, 76] that human knowledge needs to be integrated into the analysis loop for reliable analyses."

Although ego graph- like causal graphs support an effective analysis for the target area, causal analyses can be enhanced with more complex causal graphs, such as by involving the relations between neighbor sensors. However, analyzing the complex graphs in a spatiotemporal context is challenging. For example, visual clutter is hard to avoid because the geo- fixed nodes make the causal graph layout methods inapplicable [65,76]. It also becomes difficult to clearly reveal the temporal variations of the detected causalities as the number of edges increases. Utilizing the third dimension can be a potential solution [5, 14, 62, 80] and deserves further study. Secondly, due to the lack of multi- source datasets in the same temporal and spatial scope, the effectiveness of our method in cross- domain causal analysis has not been proven. In fact, causality may exist between different urban datasets. For example, as the traffic volume increases, the air quality will deteriorate because cars emit exhaust gas and pollute the air [83]. In the future, we will collect richer datasets and conduct studies, thereby evaluating and improving our approaches. Finally, we found that when the number of links to be tested in all time windows is more than 150, the calculation time exceeds ten seconds. In the future, we will optimize the detection model, implement it with a more high- performance programming language, and deploy it to a distributed computing server."

This study compared the optimization effects of these two methods and developed a new scheme that combines DA and BC simultaneously.

With the advancements made in this line of research, BC methods have been developed from the earlier complete forecast method (Klein et al., 1959) to the model output statistical method (Glahn and Lowry, 1972), and then gradually evolved into different BC schemes. Frequency matching, Bayesian averaging, least- squares regression, multiple linear regression, and other statistical methods have been used to establish BC models, which significantly reduce systematic errors by learning the empirical relationships between historical forecasts and observations to realize BC (Raftery et al., 2005; Zhu and Luo, 2015; Xie et al., 2012; Chen et al., 2012; You, 2014). Recently, artificial- intelligence machine- learning techniques have emerged. Subsequently, BC based on machine- learning methods has been shown to better express the auxiliary links between various facets of the atmosphere, including, for instance, the different elements involved in atmospheric chemistry and key basic meteorological variables such as temperature and winds (Marzban, 2003; Zhang et al., 2022). Machine- learning models have been used in the BC of model outputs to improve  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  forecasts. For example, Ran et al. (2023) performed BC based on a multiple linear regression modeling approach to reduce the global  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  prediction bias; and Liu and Xing (2022a), Liu and Xing (2022b) designed a fully connected deep neural network to correct the  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  concentration bias in the outputs of chemical models, achieving better results than without the correction method applied. Ma et al. (2020) applied a time series model to correct  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  forecasts, which achieved good results. Different machine- learning methods were utilized by Li et al. (2021) as bias adjustment for postprocessing forecasts of  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  and  $\\mathrm{O}_3$ , showing the optimal approach to be the Random Forest model. Lu et al. (2020) utilized machine- learning methods to improve the accuracy of  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  forecasts through WRF- Chem in the Chengdu- Chongqing region. Overall, machine- learning methods have shown strong advantages in mining nonlinear relationships, enabling them to perform well in the BC of numerical predictions. However, they usually require massive, multi- source data inputs, which can limit their applicability in specific scenarios."

    "paragraph_info": "By adding a multiscale convolution module and depth- separable module based on the classical UNet deep- learning segmentation network (Ronneberger et al., 2015), a new deep- learning method was constructed for BC of WRF- Chem predictions, named MDS- UNet (Ma et al.,2024). Actually, a multiscale convolution module was joined to connect and extract different scales of feature maps, and the depth- separable convolution can compress the feature mapping. MDS- UNet shows advantages in multiscale feature learning due to its multiscale convolution module, as compared with the traditional UNet. The single convolution kernel in the traditional model can only catch some of the features of the pollutants with a fixed scale. However, pollution characteristics vary on different spatial scales and multiscale convolution adopts a hierarchical structure with different spatial sizes of convolution kernels to extract the multiscale features by learning feature maps from the image. By merging feature maps of different scale, not only the pollutant concentration values, but also the spatial information on pollutant distributions, can then be obtained. The model has three advantages: acquisition of multiscale information, acquiring surrounding spatial information, and reducing information loss."

In the control experiment,  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  predictions were largely overestimated over YRD, CC, and around SCB, and underestimated in Shanxi Province, while the WRF- Chem_DA_BC experiment adjusted the concentrations in these regions. By combining the adjustment of the model input and corrections to the model output, the  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  prediction distribution and values were much closer to the observations, showing large advantages over these important regions examined in this study (Hong et al., 2022; Jiang et al., 2013; Ma et al., 2024). Despite the overall improvement associated with the combined application of DA and BC, there was still little or no improvement over some cities in Northeast China due to the lack of observations, which will need further research."

The adjustment of emissions has been proved to be critical in terms of the improvement of aerosol predictions in previous studies (Henze et al., 2009; Ku and Park, 2011). As such, greater optimization might be achievable by the additional assimilation of air quality data through applying an inverse method to retrieve an optimized emission inventory based on the model configuration as in the WRF- Chem_DA_BC experiment, which will be analyzed in future work."

The remarkable regional difference may be associated with the variation in precursor gas emissions from biogenic sources, with a notably higher level of such emissions found over the Amazon than over Africa (fig. S14). In comparison, model estimates of SOA production are very uncertain and usually fail to show regional differences between the Amazon and Africa. Our estimation, to our knowledge, is the first one in which SOA formation is constrained by aerosol absorption, which provides an innovative perspective on SOA estimation. The results also highlight the importance of SOA during fire seasons. This particular aspect has often been overlooked, and our findings emphasize the need for further research."

In particular, the average of the absolute relative errors for predicted BC emissions are 17 and  $14\\%$  for the Amazon and Southern Africa, respectively, which are much smaller than the uncertainty in our main analysis using real observations.

However, the STC is plagued by well- known issues such as visual occlusion and depth ambiguity, which are further exacerbated when dealing with large- scale spatial time series data. In this study, we introduce a novel technical framework termed VolumeSTCube, designed for continuous spatiotemporal phenomena. It first leverages the concept of the STC to transform discretely distributed spatial time series data into continuously volumetric data. Subsequently, volume rendering and surface rendering techniques are employed to visualize the transformed volumetric data. Volume rendering is utilized to mitigate visual occlusion, while surface rendering provides pattern details by enhanced lighting information. Lastly, we design interactions to facilitate the exploration and analysis from temporal, spatial, and spatiotemporal perspectives. VolumeSTCube is evaluated through a computational experiment, a real- world case study with one expert, and a controlled user study with twelve non- experts, compared against a baseline from prior work, showing its superiority and effectiveness in large- scale spatial time series analysis."

Linked views require users to pay context- switching costs to browse the spatial and temporal visualizations separately. In contrast, an integrated view tightly organizes the spatial and temporal visualizations to reduce such costs. The spacetime cube (STC) [6] is a kind of integrated view in a three- dimensional space, in which the space naturally occupies two dimensions (i.e., x- y plane), and the time constitutes the third dimension (i.e., z- axis). The position of the visual graphics can be directly related to both space and time dimensions. It is easy for users to accept and learn, and thus, users can perceive time and space simultaneously [7]. Moreover, in the STC, the evolution of spatiotemporal phenomena can be effectively conveyed through temporal narratives, as geographic- related information is visualized along a continuous timeline [8]."

Prior studies [14]- [16] adopted the STC to visualize ST series (e.g., Figure 1), but only a few timestamps (e.g.,  $\\leq 30$  are applicable. It remains unexplored how to enable in- depth visual analysis of large- scale, highly dynamic, and multi- correlated ST series data based on the STC.

For example, in Yu and He's traffic data analysis [20], they learned that \"during the morning peak, the major departure locations are dispersed across Yuexiu district, Liwan district, and western Haizhu district ... In Muthoni et al.'s meteorology analysis [22], they concluded that \"the annual rainfall anomalies revealed that ESA (Eastern and Southern Africa) region received above normal rainfall in 1982, 1989, 1997 and 2006, with the latter being the most severe.\" However, the basic task becomes rather difficult given large- scale ST series that expand a vast spatial range, involve a long time period with thousands of timestamps, and exhibit inter- correlated and highly time- varying natures."

The time- varying values of the ST series can be mapped to the column's vertical position. Second, as shown in Figure 2B, the cube space is evenly divided into voxels, i.e., small regular cubes. We apply interpolation and temporal smoothing to estimate the value  $v$  for every voxel with a 3D position  $(x,y,z)$ . As a result, all voxels together constitute a space- time volume where the values of adjacent voxels tend to be continuous. Finally, the space- time volume is visualized with volume and surface rendering techniques (Figure 2C).

Assuming we are visualizing the ST series of air pollution concentration, below are some examples: If a voxel cluster extends significantly in the vertical direction and over the x- y plane, it indicates that the duration of poor air quality persists across a vast spatial area (Figure 3A①). If in a vertical cylindrical area in 3D cube space are voxel clusters with equal spacing, the air pollution exhibits periodicity at that location (Figure 3A②). If the voxel cluster exhibits shifts in 3D cube space, it indicates a process of air pollution propagation (Figure 3B and C)."

Some regions were particularly polluted during certain months, for example, the spatiotemporal partitions denoted in Figure 6A1. To make the representation clearer, PA increased the threshold  $\\lambda$  to 150. AQI  $>150$  means the air is moderately polluted, according to China's Ministry of Environmental Protection. In this way, PA could also pay more attention to the occurrences of moderate and severe air pollution."

In the future, we plan to implement a rendering parameter adjustment control to alleviate this problem. For example, the mapping of values to transparency and color can be adjusted interactively. Finally, most subjects expressed that surface rendering offered clear boundaries for voxel clusters, aiding in obtaining specific values at spatiotemporal positions and assessing propagation processes.
