Numerous factors influence air quality, necessitating accurate prediction models. When forecasting air quality K hours in advance, the methodology involves utilizing a set of meteorological data, which includes seven key parameters: temperature, wind speed, wind direction, rainfall, lowest air pressure, highest air pressure, and humidity. To effectively integrate this meteorological data into predictive models, these parameters, especially temperature, wind speed, air pressure, and humidity, are aggregated into a grid cell system. This systematic approach to data aggregation enhances the capability to predict air quality over a given forecast horizon."

ConvLSTM effectively captures spatiotemporal dependencies within the data, outperforming traditional recurrent neural network (RNN) and CNN-based models. By employing a convolutional-based transition mechanism in both input-to-state and state-to-state processes, as suggested by Shi et al., ConvLSTM is designed to address the intricate spatiotemporal nature of air pollution prediction. Our approach involves an Encoding-Forecasting ConvLSTM structure that enhances sequence prediction through a concatenation of forecasting layers, culminating in a 1x1 convolution to produce the final output. Notably, ConvLSTM models demonstrated superior performance in interpolation tasks compared to baseline models like Stacked FC-LSTM and CNN Encoder-Decoder, with enhanced accuracy indicated by RMSE comparisons across various configurations. Additionally, we incorporate spatiotemporal loss functions and semi-supervised learning techniques to refine predictions. Our findings suggest that integrating more spatiotemporal data can significantly improve interpolation outcomes, as evidenced by ConvLSTM variations that incorporate additional spatial and temporal factors. Overall, this research highlights ConvLSTM's potential in delivering more accurate air quality predictions, revealing its capability to outperform other state-of-the-art models in capturing both spatial and temporal complexities."

The primary objective of DeepAir is to forecast the Air Quality Index (AQI) over the next K hours for each monitoring station. To achieve this, DeepAir incorporates a spatial transformation component that treats the data from monitoring stations as secondary pollutant sources, creating a consistent input for each location. It accounts for both the historical air quality of a geo-location and the air quality of its neighboring regions. DeepAir's architecture features a distributed fusion approach, which designates one feature as the main feature and other inputs as auxiliary, enhancing the main feature by capturing influences from these auxiliary inputs in parallel. This approach significantly improves the model's ability to predict air quality by integrating all influential factors via specially designed subnets: a historical weather subnet (HI), and both historical (HW) and future (WF) meteorological condition nets. FusionNet then synthesizes AQI data, time, and station ID to generate the final predictions. DeepAir is distinctive for its accuracy, even amidst abrupt changes in the environmental conditions, and is capable of providing detailed station-level predictions over a 48-hour forecast horizon. It efficiently utilizes spatial neighbor signals to grasp dynamic air quality changes, outperforming other fusion methodologies and eliminating the need for time-consuming sequence design required in sequential fusion models. This robust architecture allows DeepAir to surpass existing methods in predicting air quality not only at a given station but also across regions, achieving superior accuracy and extended prediction periods."

    "summary": "The paper introduces DeepAir, a sophisticated air quality forecasting system that offers fine-grained predictions for over 300 Chinese cities on an hourly basis, projecting up to 48 hours into the future. Predicting air quality is inherently challenging due to its spatial and temporal fluctuations, which lack obvious periodic patterns. The DeepAir system, integrated via a 'cloud + client' framework, employs an advanced distributed fusion architecture. This architecture captures the interactions between various factors that influence air quality, both at individual and holistic levels. Each monitoring station within the system, denoted by the set S, has its future AQI predicted through AQI_S^{T+k}. Historical weather data, forecasts, secondary productions, and meta properties are among the factors modeled by the system through five subnets (HW, WF, SP, MP, and HI). These subnets assess influences from weather parameters (such as wind speed, direction, humidity, and pressure) and terrain. The system utilizes an embedding method to transform raw data into a low-dimensional space, thereby enhancing the capture of temporal correlations and intra-dynamics. Importantly, spatial partitioning consolidates scattered air quality data, calculating an average AQI for regions with at least one monitoring station. Weather forecasts and air quality predictions are divided into 3-hour intervals, with district-level projections offering a min-max range for the subsequent 12 hours. Comparative analyses reveal the superiority of the distributed over sequential architectures, with relative accuracy improvements evident in short-term, long-term, and sudden change predictions across different cities. Each air quality record in DeepAir is comprehensive, encompassing concentrations of key pollutants, such as PM2.5, PM10, NO2, CO, O3, and SO2. This innovative approach outperforms existing models like DeepSD and FFA, showcasing its efficacy and reliability in air quality forecasting tasks."

Temporal dependencies and intra-dynamics of each influential factor are captured using embedding techniques. The forecasts are updated every 12 hours, with specific thresholds set at 100 in the next two hours and 150 in the next three hours.

    "summary": "The paper addresses the challenge of predicting air quality, which is a complex task impacted by multiple factors such as weather conditions, pollutants, and terrain. The authors have developed a deep distributed fusion network that integrates various datasets, including air quality indices (AQIs), meteorology, weather forecasts, and pollutants, to improve prediction accuracy. Using a geospatial approach, they employ Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) to assign weights to readings from nearby monitoring stations to refine the data input for their model. They designed five subnets to model the interactions between these contributing factors, such as time and terrain, with one specific subnet, the meta property (MP) subnet, focusing on these properties. Outputs from these subnets are merged using a parametric-matrix-based fusion, allowing the model to adapt to dynamic influences over time. The weather forecast data, though segmented for every three hours, are crucial despite their inaccuracies. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of this system, named DeepAir, in predicting air quality changes, even under complex conditions. It outperforms a previous state-of-the-art model, FFA, particularly in short-term, long-term, and sudden air quality shifts across major Chinese cities, as evidenced by comparisons presented in Figure 8 and comprehensive results shown in Table 6. This research situates itself within the broader domain of air quality prediction technologies, advancing the field with a focus on integrating domain knowledge into data-driven models to address the inherent difficulty of modeling long-term sudden changes in air quality."

    "summary": "This study investigates new particle formation (NPF) in the troposphere, highlighting its role as a significant source of aerosol particles and cloud condensation nuclei. The research primarily focuses on the Po Valley, where the formation mechanisms and growth rates of NPF are not fully understood. High formation rates of sub-2 nm particles and nucleation-mode growth rates, coupled with a relatively low condensational sink, suggest a high survival probability for newly formed particles. Advanced instrumentation, including the Vocus's focusing ion-molecule reactor (FIMR) and the Airmodus A10 with an A11 nano-CNC system, enables detailed analysis of size distributions and cluster identification. In the Po Valley, specific precursors like NH3, DMA, and amines play crucial roles in NPF, with TMA significantly enhancing nucleation rates. The study notes the presence of various ion clusters, with ambient NH3 or TMA potentially influencing cluster formation. Despite observed high amounts of CHON compounds, organic oxidation products do not appear to drive the NPF process. The research indicates that precursor abundance, rather than variations in the pre-existing sink or the condensational sink (CS), predominantly controls NPF occurrence. The mechanism of NPF in the Po Valley resembles that in Chinese megacities, suggesting common underlying processes. The study also explores the impact of reducing key species like SO2, amines, and NH3 on suppressing NPF frequency and particle numbers, underscoring NPF's decisive role in influencing aerosol and PM2.5 concentrations in the region."

    "summary": "Frequent new particle formation (NPF) events have been documented in heavily polluted urban environments, including in settings with varying levels of pollution. For instance, while Barcelona (Spain) is considerably less polluted than some Asian megacities, it still experiences NPF events. During the observation period in Barcelona, the daily average temperature varied from 1 to 17 °C, accompanied by an average wind speed of approximately 2.4 ± 1.5 m/s. These conditions suggest that in polluted environments like the Po Valley, the growth of particles requires substantial clustering to overcome losses to the existing condensation sink, highlighting the complex interplay between environmental factors and NPF occurrence."

    "summary": "The Po Valley region in northern Italy is recognized as a significant area for high aerosol loadings and frequent new particle formation (NPF) events within southern Europe, paralleling similar occurrences in other polluted areas like the Yangtze River Delta. NPF is a ubiquitous atmospheric phenomenon that significantly influences global climate by dominating aerosol number concentrations and contributing substantially to the ultrafine aerosol budget. In the Po Valley, previous studies have observed frequent NPF events characterized by high nucleation and growth rates, with new sub-3 nm particle clusters forming on 66% of the days. These events are driven primarily by high sulfuric acid concentrations and the presence of stabilizing alkaline molecules such as amines and ammonia, likely stemming from regional agricultural activities. During NPF event days, high formation rates of sub-2 nm neutral particles and sulfuric acid concentrations reaching approximately 1 × 10⁷ cm⁻³ were documented. The growth rates of particles during these events were consistent with previous research, indicating a high survival probability for newly formed particles. Moreover, the observed particle formation rates during NPF events with growth were similar to those of earlier studies, suggesting sulfuric acid and stabilizing molecules are key in controlling particle formation and growth. Understanding the mechanisms and growth processes of NPF, alongside the roles of pre-existing particles and gaseous precursors, is crucial for effective air pollution control and comprehending the high frequency of NPF in polluted regions like the Po Valley."

    "summary": "A continuous two-month measurement campaign was conducted in the Po Valley, northern Italy, to elucidate new particle formation (NPF) and growth mechanisms using state-of-the-art instruments. Frequent NPF events were observed, occurring on 66% of the days, and were primarily driven by high concentrations of sulfuric acid (SA) (8.5 x 10^6 cm^{-3}) and basic molecules, notably including amines and ammonia, which are abundant in the region due to agricultural activities. The initial NPF and subsequent growth rates were characterized using particle number size distribution measurements down to 1 nm. It was found that the median particle formation rates at 1.7, 3, and 7 nm during NPF with growth events were 87 cm^{-3} s^{-1}, 3.2 cm^{-3} s^{-1}, and 1.4 cm^{-3} s^{-1}, respectively, while the days without significant growth had a much lower average formation rate of 24 cm^{-3} s^{-1}. Oxygenated organic molecules (OOMs) also contributed to NPF and particle growth, without the necessity of SA, highlighting the involvement of other participating species. Despite the presence of iodine-containing compounds likely from the Adriatic Sea, significant iodine-induced NPF was not observed, contrasting with more pristine marine environments. NPF in the Po Valley did not strongly depend on the condensation sink (CS) levels, which showed no significant difference between NPF event days and non-event days. The absence of ultra-low-volatility organics in ion and neutral cluster measurements might explain this finding. The study concluded that while the Po Valley experiences frequent and strong NPF events primarily driven by sulfuric acid and basic molecules, other vapors are necessary for particles to grow beyond 3 nm. These results align with observations from other regions, such as Shanghai and Beijing, where similar key contributors to particle formation have been identified."

    "summary": "The study explores the intricate processes involved in atmospheric new particle formation (NPF) and growth, primarily focusing on the role of oxygenated organic molecules (OOMs) and sulfuric acid (SA) compounds. While OOMs play a minor role in the initial cluster formation from the atmospheric oxidation of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), they significantly contribute to the growth process, becoming predominant during consecutive growth. The research employs a sophisticated measurement system, including the Airmodus nanoparticle diluter (AND) for sample dilution and the HFDMPS for determining particle size distribution, allowing precise monitoring of particles from 2 to 15 nm. With both polarities measured at 15 predefined size steps, the instrumentation enables detailed observation of NPF events—days classified as 'NPF with growth' are identified when growing modes are visible in both PSM and HFDMPS data. The model treats the formation rate of SA tetramers as a proxy for simulated particle formation rates. The study highlights the relationship between SA dimer concentration and the square of monomer concentrations, along with condensation sink (CS) levels. Notably, the detection of additional clusters beyond SA-DMA suggests other candidate bases could significantly impact nucleation under complex atmospheric conditions. Figure 5 presents an overview of critical parameters and gaseous precursors involved in NPF across the Po Valley and similar environments, offering insights into formation rates, varied atmospheric concentrations of ammonia, SA, and DMA, CS levels, and growth rates, encapsulated within median values and their respective percentiles. The findings underscore that while OOMs contribute substantially to growth, the role of additional substances such as DMA and other nucleating agents cannot be overlooked."

    "summary": "In this study, the stabilization of sulfuric acid clusters in the Po Valley is investigated, with a focus on the role of amines. It was found that amines alone are insufficient to stabilize all such clusters. Various amines observed in the SA4-B clusters include methylamine, dimethylamine (DMA), trimethylamine, and butylamine. The presence of sulfuric acid monomers is most prominent during peak hours (10:00-14:00 LT) on both new particle formation (NPF) and non-NPF days. Additionally, the fraction of nitrogen-containing organics (CHON) was found to be 60% – 70% of the total identified oxidized organic molecules (OOMs), highlighting their significant contribution. Measurements and particle size magnification were carried out using the Airmodus A11 nano-CNC, commonly known as the particle size magnifier (PSM). Particle diameters were tracked from the start time $t_i$ to the end time $t_{ext{f}}$, denoted as $d_{ext{p,i}}$ and $d_{ext{p,f}}$, respectively. Formation rates at 1.7, 3, and 7 nm, both from this study and prior work by Kontkanen et al.

    "summary": "In investigating nucleation processes in the Po Valley, it was determined that sulfuric acid-base nucleation is the primary mechanism. Various advanced measurement techniques were employed to analyze these processes. The concentration of sulfuric acid (SA) was measured using a CI-APi-ToF mass spectrometer, which operates with a focusing ion-molecule reactor at specific pressure and frequency parameters. This instrument, along with the Airmodus A11 nano-CNC system and the high-flow differential mobility particle sizer (HFDMPS), provided detailed particle size distribution data for sub-3 nm and sub-10 nm particles. The HFDMPS, in combination with particle size magnifiers (PSM), enabled precise characterization of particle formation and growth rates. The formation rates were computed using the balance equations involving combined-DMPS size distributions. Ion cluster measurements and kinetic models indicated that ammonia (around 10 ppb) is a significant factor in nucleation, along with sulfuric acid. High fractions of SA and ammonia-containing clusters, such as SA-NH₃ and SA-NH₃-amine, were also observed, mirroring findings from CLOUD chamber studies under low-DMA and high-ammonia conditions. During nucleation peak hours, dimethylamine (DMA) concentrations were found to be lower than what is required to reach the kinetic limit. Additional evidence suggested that other alkaline molecules could contribute to nucleation and particle growth, as seen with the increase of certain compounds ($C_{2-4}H_{4.5}N_{0.1}O_{3.4}$) under elevated humidity conditions. Overall, the research shows variability in new particle formation (NPF) precursors and mechanisms across different studies and regions."

Recognizing NPF's critical role in the aerosol number budget, the study identified that high levels of pre-existing aerosols, acting as condensation sinks (CSs), rapidly scavenge gaseous precursors, impacting NPF processes. Despite the Po Valley having a significantly lower population density compared to Asian megacities, sub-2 nm neutral particles were formed at rates between 10 to 100 cm⁻³ s⁻¹. These particles were subsequently channeled to a CPC (Airmodus A20) for optical detection and growth analysis. Solar radiation and low aerosol water content were found to be conducive to NPF, while the interference of ammonia from fertilization was noted as a challenge in similar agricultural atmospheres. Throughout the two-month measurement campaign, the researchers observed large concentrations of sulfuric acid and organics, detected by CI-APi-ToF, facilitating rapid particle growth beyond 3 nm. The study noted a frequency of NPF events in line with findings by Hamed et al. (2007), with a comparison of event frequencies indicating a higher occurrence in summer than spring. These insights contribute to a better understanding of NPF dynamics, emphasizing the necessity to explore site-specific environmental factors influencing particle formation and growth."

Their small size enables them to penetrate deep into the respiratory system, potentially leading to adverse health effects. This concern is heightened in areas with high pollution levels, where the concentration of ultrafine particles is typically elevated, increasing exposure and the associated health risks. Addressing the impact of these particles is crucial for public health, requiring comprehensive monitoring and mitigation strategies in affected areas."

Shen et al. (2021) reported that such events occur on approximately 70% of the days during spring and summer. In comparison, Kontkanen et al. (2016) observed even higher NPF activity in July, with events occurring on 89% of the days at the same site. Similarly, Hamed et al. (2007) noted that 60% of summer days included NPF events with growth. The methodology aligns with Dada et al. (2018), who differentiated NPF days by clustering and visible growth. On NPF days, certain regions, like the Po Valley, experience elevated concentrations of sulfuric acid (SA), which are double those on non-NPF days. Contrarily, non-NPF days exhibit extremely high levels of nitrophenols and homologous compounds, nearly eight times higher than on NPF days. In Delhi, daytime NPF events from January to February are suppressed due to strong biomass burning emissions and a high abundance of primary organics. Additionally, high concentrations of carboxylic acids, such as formic, oxalic, and malonic acids, have been reported during springtime in the Po Valley."

    "summary": "The previous assertion that new particle formation (NPF) events are less likely in polluted areas is challenged by findings from Kontkanen et al. (2017), who reported a high occurrence of NPF (89% of summer days). This process involves the condensation of dimethylglyoxime (DEG) on particles in a growth tube and further growth facilitated by butanol in a condensation particle counter (CPC). Growth rates of particles have been found to increase with diameter. However, at nighttime, sulfuric acid (SA) concentrations drop to nearly zero due to the scavenging effects on sulfur dioxide (SO2) and SA caused by high relative humidity (RH). High RH can inhibit photochemical activities, reducing the formation of sulfuric acid and low-volatility condensable vapors. In addition, the concentration of nitrate ($NO_3^-$) ions is observed to increase by 50% on days without NPF compared to those with NPF. The formation rates, growth rates, and concentrations of SA, along with condensation sink (CS) metrics during NPF events in regions including Beijing, Shanghai, Hyytiälä, Jungfraujoch, and Chacaltaya are reported by Deng et al. (2020)."

These vapors likely consist of a mixture of organic compounds from both anthropogenic and biogenic sources.

Mass defect plots, which illustrate the difference between a compound's exact and nominal mass, provided further analytical insights. It was observed that the probability of NPF decreases significantly, reaching 50% when the condensation sink (CS) was approximately $1 \\times 10^{-2} \\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ and completely ceasing at a CS of $6 \\times 10^{-2} \\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. During our sampling period, the values of dimethylamine (DMA) measured were nearly at the detection limit of the Vocus instrument, which suggests that the DMA levels in the valley region were insufficient to stabilize high concentrations of sulfuric acid (SA). Despite DMA being more effective than ammonia, it was inadequate to stabilize all SA, indicating the potential need for additional stabilizing agents or alternative methodologies to support SA during the study period."

Measurements were adjusted due to lower concentrations recorded by the Hauke-type DMPS. Research indicated that particle formation in the region is heavily influenced by the oxidation products of anthropogenic volatile organic compounds. These reactions typically involve the presence of SA tetramers, pentamers, and hexamers, advancing particle formation processes. The composition of oxidized organic molecules (OOMs) showed similarities between new particle formation (NPF) and non-NPF days, albeit with varying levels of concentration.

    "summary": "The study conducted in the densely populated Po Valley region, with over 17 million residents within 70,000 km², focused on new particle formation (NPF) measurements during March and April 2022. Measurements were taken using sophisticated instruments housed in a temperature-controlled container, where the Particle Size Magnifier (PSM) turbulently mixed sample flows with diethylene glycol (DEG) in a mixing section. The particle number concentrations obtained from the Differential Mobility Particle Sizer (DMPS) showed, on average, concentrations that were two times lower than those measured by a reference Condensation Particle Counter (CPC) at the same site. Daily particle size distributions were analyzed to identify growing modes, revealing varying conditions impacting NPF frequency, likely due to seasonal differences. During the study, simulations conducted at 283 K, atmospheric pressure of 1.01 × 10⁵ Pa, and a condensation sink of 0.01 s⁻¹ were used to assess NPF processes. Sulfuric acid (SA), known as a key gaseous precursor in continental NPF, alongside ambient concentrations of NH₃ (~10 ppb) and amines, contributed to cluster formation. The formation rate of 1.7 nm particles (J1.7) was related to SA concentrations, hinting that sulfuric acid condensation is typically adequate for the growth of the smallest clusters. Significant variations in SO₂ concentrations between NPF and non-NPF days were noted, influencing these processes. The research also investigates how NOx affects organic aerosol particle growth rates. Ultimately, the study underlines the significant role of NPF in impacting fine particle concentrations and pollution levels in the Po Valley. The findings are consistent with previous research from the site, specifically data from the summer of 2009."

Most measurements from the CLOUD chamber were conducted above the SA–NH<sub>3</sub> system at 278 K, providing insight into the conditions affecting aerosol formation. The hourly CS (Condensation Sink) levels helped quantify the capacity of pre-existing particles to act as a medium for new particle formation. During spring, the presence of DMA (dimethylamine) in the Po Valley is insufficient to stabilize all atmospheric SA (sulfuric acid) clusters completely, as evidenced by the concentrations presented with uncertainties based on Wang et al.

In this study, we observed significant diurnal variations in organic nitrogen (ON) concentrations, with specific attention paid to the correlations between ON and other atmospheric components. Organic and elemental carbon (OC and EC) were monitored using a semicontinuous OC/EC analyzer, while a thermal desorption Aerosol Gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (TAG) was employed to quantify a range of speciated organic markers. In particular, particles collected were subjected to thermal desorption followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis for detailed chemical profiling. Our results indicated that primary cooking emissions notably contributed 5 ± 4% to the ambient particulate matter during dinner time. While speciated nitroaromatic-N typically accounted for less than 10% of total nitroaromatic-N in most cases (>90%), ON exhibited stronger associations with $NO_x$ $(R^2 = 0.45)$ and nitrate $(R^2 = 0.39)$ compared to isoprene- and α-pinene-derived secondary organic aerosol (SOA) tracers $(R^2 = 0.18-0.19)$.

In this study, particles were collected onto a thermal desorption cell (CTD) to analyze their composition. Source identification involved established molecular and elemental markers that helped identify the presence and formation pathways of various compounds. The formation of nitrates was indicated by nitrate $(NO_3^-)$, with nitrocatechols being formed through the nitration of catechols emitted from biomass burning. This secondary formation pathway correlated well with the presence of levoglucosan, suggesting a strong link between biomass burning and nitrocatechol formation. Additionally, the neutralization of sulfate and nitrate limits the absorption of organic bases like amines. Acids and carbonyls tend to accumulate during the day as a result of photochemical processes. In Type 3 cases, increases in secondary organic nitrates (SON) are mainly driven by the oxidation of emissions from cooking activities. Organic nitrates have been long recognized as significant constituents of secondary organic aerosols (OAs) in ambient air."

The research identifies several organic aerosol (OA) formation processes through distinct tracers, including oxygenated cooking emissions characterized by azelaic acid and other carboxylic acids, and phthalic acid used to identify specific secondary OA formation pathways. The sulfate and nitrate formation processes were substantial, with nitrate contributing the largest fraction (14%) of the organic nitrogen (ON) mass. Photochemical processes also played a significant role, contributing 10% to the ON. The study highlights the significant presence of unidentified N-containing compounds and explores the correlation between dicarboxylic acid (DCA) and ammonium concentrations, showing a rapid formation of DCA_ON. The analyses suggest that nitrogen-bearing secondary organic aerosols (SON) from ammonia-related chemistry are a substantial source of nitrogenous SOA, often with a C/N ratio lower than 4, formed predominantly through photochemical processes. This investigation into secondary formation mechanisms is crucial for developing targeted mitigation strategies, especially noting nitrate formation's considerable impact, quantified by its contribution to the particulate matter mass observed."

A range of nitroaromatic compounds, significant in nitrogen-containing organic aerosols (OA), was observed, indicating their prominent role in ON chemistry. Specifically, nitrocatechol formation, exemplified by 4-nitrocatechol, illustrates typical nitroaromatic processes. Photochemical formation processes of ON compounds were significantly elevated from noon to the afternoon, suggesting a strong diurnal effect. During this period, secondary formation processes of nitroaromatic compounds, alongside nitrate formation, contributed to the increase in solid organic nitrogen (SON), though nitrate's impact was comparatively minor. The formation mechanisms for these ON compounds likely involve the reactive uptake of N2O/NO3 radicals by unsaturated fatty acid particles, particularly in oxygenated cooking emissions. Furthermore, the reactive gas-phase formation of organic nitrates, followed by their partitioning to the particle phase, is inconsistent with the low carbon-to-nitrogen ratios observed, suggesting alternate pathways. Acid-catalyzed ON formation pathways were shown to be suppressed by the neutralization of sulfate and nitrate. Excess ammonium (NH4+) is hypothesized to interact with organic acids like dicarboxylic acids (DCAs) to form organic ammonium salts. Additionally, Xu et al. (2020) identified that aerosol liquid water likely facilitates the formation of water-soluble ON, possibly as organic nitrate species, further highlighting the complexity of ON formation processes."

This aligns with previous laboratory and field studies indicating that the particulate NH4+ levels, as reported by AMS, often exceed what is necessary to balance anions such as nitrate, sulfate, and chloride. Assuming an average molecular formula of C5H7N1.5O1.5 for the reduced-ON species, their concentrations were estimated to be between 43-592 ng m−3. Further research is essential to elucidate the major chemical compositions and formation mechanisms of these compounds. Chamber simulations have demonstrated that secondary organic aerosol (SOA) generated from the oxidation of cooking fumes may surpass the primary organic aerosol (OA) from cooking emissions. Consequently, future research should focus on investigating representative nitrogen-containing molecules formed through cooking oxidation and elucidating their formation pathways."

Bulk ON measurement has proven valuable for achieving mass closure and investigating the primary sources of ON aerosols. The analysis highlights notable contributions from secondary formation pathways, illuminating diverse precursors and chemical processes, including the reactions of acids or carbonyls with ammonia ($NH_3$) or ammonium ($NH_4^+$), which contribute to reduced ON species. Specifically, the research supports the hypothesis that DCA_ON, a type of reduced ON species, is likely formed through these interactions. Moreover, NHx+ fragments observed in the study may originate not only from ammonium itself but also from other reduced ON species such as amines and amides, indicating a complex interplay of chemical reactions in the urban atmosphere."

The use of an 18 factor solution demonstrated exceptional alignment with the observed ON and organic carbon (OC) masses, attributing significant primary sources to coal combustion and vehicle emissions, each contributing 21% to the aerosol ON. Additionally, the study examined daily variations of cooking emission-related tracers, revealing that cooking oxidation potentially plays a significant role in the formation of nitrogen-containing secondary organic aerosols (SOA) in urban environments. However, sulfate and ON showed poor correlation, with an R<sup>2</sup> of 0.05.

The chemiluminescence technique was employed to detect the nitrogen signal after converting $NO_{u}$ to NO, while major water-soluble ionic species in PM<sub>2.5</sub> were measured using the MARGA. Findings suggest sulfate-driven processes played a minor role in ON formation under observed conditions, with secondary oxidation products originating from primary cooking emissions showing significant increases during dinner hours. Specific formation processes, such as those of dicarboxylic acid aerosols (DCAs) and nitrocatechols, contributed 8% and 7% to the ON budget respectively. DCA_ON displayed a strong correlation with $NH_4^+$, indicating possible interactions or shared pathways. Notably, during a specific observation period on 4 December, newly formed secondary organic nitrogen (Δ SON) and secondary organic carbon (Δ SOC) were quantified as 0.16 µg N m^{-3} and 1.15 µg C m^{-3}, respectively.

Isoprene- and α-pinene-derived secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation was characterized by their respective oxidation products. Notably, in most cases, one nitrogen atom was present for every 7-9 carbon atoms in the collected organic aerosols (OAs), resulting in a C/N ratio of 8.4 for cooking emission-related SOA. The source apportionment analysis of secondary organic nitrogen (SON) was able to delineate contributions to individual formation pathways, although the specific incorporation of excess NH4+-N into ON-containing compounds remains unclear due to insufficient molecular-level data.

Additionally, the study notes that 8% of ON is linked to the formation of dicarboxylic acids (DCAs), which indicates high oxidative capacity and enhanced formation of secondary products. The laboratory-confirmed aqueous formation of imines like imidazoles further supports these findings. Minor contributions from nitrophenol and β-caryophyllene SOA formations are observed, along with a potential formation of N-containing organic molecules with C/N ratios of 6-8. Organic nitrate formation occurs via two main pathways: OH-radical initiated oxidation during the day and NO3-radical initiated oxidation at night, both leading to gas-to-particle phase partitioning. The study presents evidence for organic nitrates potentially forming through heterogeneous or aqueous reactions, stressing the need for further exploration of these pathways and mechanisms. Significant findings include enhanced SON and SOC with nitrocatechol formation, providing insights into precursor compounds like NOx. The study's amalgamation of observational data and previous research underscores an imperative to delve deeper into secondary ON aerosol formation mechanisms via NH3 and NOx chemistries, further exploring pathways including nitroaromatics and oxygenated cooking OA."

The production of organic nitrates in the atmosphere is a result of both radical and non-radical reactions. Radical pathways involve the reactions of biogenic volatile organic compounds like isoprene and α-pinene with NO<sup>x</sup> or NO<sup>3</sup> radicals. Non-radical pathways, as suggested by previous studies, involve the aqueous phase reactions of hydrated glyoxal with nitric acid.

Additionally, the analysis identified four Type 4 cases, where the increase in ON was dominated by the formation of nitrocatechol. Similarly, four Type 5 cases were characterized by the nitrate formation process driving the increase in SON."

The sheer volume of potential patterns often hinders users' comprehension, necessitating a tool like AirVis to facilitate insight into these complex processes.\n\nA detailed analysis of pollution propagation was conducted, revealing that star-like propagation structures might indicate major pollution sources, with these being extracted as significant motifs. However, no current visualization tool existed to analyze pollution propagation effectively until this system was developed. AirVis constructs propagation graphs from transportation graphs, representing transportation instances. By recursively adding spatiotemporally continuous transportation graphs to form a propagation graph, the system allows for the visualization of continuous long-distance propagation instances.\n\nThe system aggregates similar patterns into motifs based on topology, applying the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle to reduce the number of graphs and address the scalability issue, thereby improving the perception of significant patterns. These motifs can be sorted by their edge properties such as mean or variance, providing a clearer insight into pollution correlations across various districts, as highlighted in case studies involving cities like Tangshan, Tianjin, and Beijing.\n\nThe system supports side-by-side comparative analysis through juxtaposed propagation graphs and presents propagation relationships in a scalable manner. Users can explore complex propagation processes through a hierarchy of topology-pattern-instance. The effectiveness and usability of AirVis were demonstrated through case studies and expert interviews, indicating its potential applicability to other problems involving topology-driven analysis of massive small graphs."

    "summary": "The paper presents an interactive visualization system designed for pattern identification and analysis, primarily focusing on environmental pollution patterns across districts. The system employs compact pattern glyphs and pattern graphs to visually summarize complex data, with glyphs serving as ideal candidates for these visual summaries. Through the use of graph visualization techniques, such as tailored node-link diagrams based on force-directed layouts and chord diagrams, the system highlights the spatial structures and cause-effect relationships between different districts. In cases where traditional methods fall short, this system helps experts detect and analyze elusive paths of pollution propagation.\n\nKey features include the ability to add patterns to an inspection list for further detailed analysis, where each pattern's propagation process is depicted with a pattern graph. The visualization incorporates motifs, pattern glyphs, and pattern graphs, providing users with design alternatives for uncertainty visualization. This system's hierarchical exploration scheme reduces cognitive load by efficiently organizing numerous graphs during analysis.\n\nThe application of this system in case studies around Shijiazhuang revealed valuable insights into how districts interact and contribute to air pollution. Specific findings showed the potential pollution paths from Shijiazhuang to Beijing and Langfang and identified the Binhaixinqu district as receiving pollution from Tianjin and Tangshan. Such analyses were motivated by the prevalence of coal-fired power plants in the region and received positive feedback from experts. The proposed interactive pattern mining proved particularly impressive, allowing for a nuanced understanding of the data. Overall, the study highlights the importance of interactive visualization in environmental analysis and decision-making processes."

    "summary": "The paper discusses the development of an interactive visualization system designed to analyze air pollution propagation, addressing three main challenges: extracting propagation patterns, ensuring scalability, and facilitating analysis of propagation processes. Central to this system is a novel pattern mining framework based on frequent subgraph mining (FSM), which is effective in identifying frequent subgraphs representing typical propagation patterns. The system allows experts to explore these patterns via a hierarchical organization based on their topological similarities, leveraging an MDL-based approach to manage the large volume of patterns. Users can interact with the system to identify interesting topologies and perform comparative visual analysis of different propagation patterns. By selecting significant motifs in a \"motif view,\" users can delve into the detailed propagation processes in a \"pattern view,\" which has proven useful in examining real-world instances, particularly in regions such as the North China Plain and Beijing. The design enables users to recognize similarities and differences in propagation patterns by visualizing significant motifs, which represent series of propagation graphs. The study also addresses practical challenges like the readability of glyph designs due to conflicting directions of edges. The approach not only allows detailed exploration of specific propagation routes, such as from Baoding to Beijing, Beijing to Baoding, and Beijing to Huailaixian, but also offers a generalizable framework for analyzing topology-driven issues in massive small graph datasets."

The system supports comparative analysis based on cause-effect relationships, visualized with chord diagrams and motif views. The MDL principle is used for graph simplification, providing summary representations of pattern topologies with fusiform glyphs visualizing probabilities along motif edges.

This section outlines the requirements for effectively studying air pollution propagation, which involves tracking pathways between districts, such as from district i to j, with associated attributes like time, pressure, temperature, and area (w_{ij}.TT, w_{ij}.P, w_{ij}.TC, w_{ij}.A). The use of uncertainty-aware visual encodings helps visualize motifs, ensuring these motifs align with similarity constraints for accurate topological representations. EA's examination of medium air pollution patterns led to the extraction of more significant patterns based on these constraints, affirming related hypotheses.

This task generally involves three categories of visualization: direct depiction, summarization, and pattern extraction. Dynamic graph visualization techniques are implemented to manage numerous evolving graphs over time, facilitating the analysis of vast and complex datasets. To tailor the system to user needs, bi-weekly discussions with experts were conducted over a three-month period. This collaboration led to the discovery that grouping similar patterns allows experts to analyze them collectively, expediting the overall workflow. To enhance scalability and exploration efficiency, patterns are organized hierarchically, employing multiple coordinated views. Visual summaries of these patterns, presented compactly regarding their spatial and temporal contexts, are crucial. While glyph-based methods have proven effective in multifaceted analyses, users initially misinterpreted the visual encoding, mistaking it for a representation of pollutant distribution across districts. Thus, a two-level detail visual representation was adopted, including pattern glyphs, as illustrated in Fig. 1C1. However, the glyphs’ spatial compactness limits map readability. In the visualization, each district is depicted as an arc in the chord diagram, with real-time pattern generation accessible via a control panel. The analysis identified Xinjishi and Xinleshi districts as significant sources of air pollution, with pie charts illustrating pollution propagation along two distinct paths originating from these areas.

    "summary": "Spatiotemporal data visualization has been effectively utilized across various domains, allowing experts to analyze complex probabilistic cause-effect relationships, such as those between source (A) and destination (B) districts. Within these patterns, significant motifs are frequently observed, often comprising four or five nodes, and are shared among the different patterns. These patterns, represented by relatively transparent points sparsely distributed over a large area, illustrate the uncertain propagation processes on a map. An alternative visualization approach involves encoding the probability distribution directly along the edges using summarization representations like heatmaps. This method facilitates the investigation of intricate propagation patterns that encompass numerous districts. Through this analysis, experts have inferred that external pollution affecting Beijing is likely originating from Baoding."

PM2.5 and PM10 are particulate matters defined by their diameters of 2.5 µm or less and 10 µm or less, respectively. Addressing the challenge of air pollution requires effective visual analytics, as conventional plots often fail to effectively express complex spatial relationships. Visualizations, especially those designed to visualize spatio-temporal data, are pivotal for verifying hypotheses and extracting useful insights. Basic visualization methods, including heat tables, line charts, and bar graphs, serve as foundational tools to uncover specific trends or characteristics in data. More advanced visual analytics can offer clearer, more refined visualization and analysis, which are vital for both experts and government staff. Since most government officials are not subject matter experts, they require intuitive and clear methods to comprehend the pollution data—such as the spatial distribution of observation stations in Beijing—and to guide their actions against air pollutants. The study utilizes open source tools to achieve an efficient and intuitive framework for data inspection and visualization, thereby facilitating a better understanding of air quality issues and potential interventions."

    "summary": "The paper discusses a comprehensive approach to visualizing and analyzing air pollution data, focusing on the interplay of various pollutants and environmental factors such as wind, particularly in a sub-humid, warm temperate continental monsoon climate like Beijing's. The methodology emphasizes the preliminary analysis of data using visual tools such as bar charts, heat tables, and line charts to verify data quality and identify general patterns. These methods serve as a precursor to more in-depth analysis. The study introduces a visualization exploration framework that follows the observation–hypothesis–verification process, utilizing a variety of visualization techniques such as heat maps, scatter plots, and space–time cubes to analyze and validate air pollution data. For example, scatter plots demonstrate relationships among pollutants like $PM_{2.5}$, $PM_{10}$, and $NO_{2}$ with meteorological variables, highlighting a negative correlation between wind speed and pollutant concentration, as strong winds accelerate pollutant dispersion. The paper presents advanced spatio-temporal visualization methods, including circular heat maps and calendar views, which effectively display temporal data variations and pollutant distribution over time. Circular heat maps illustrate monthly and daily variations in air pollution concentrations, while calendar views provide insights into daily pollutant levels over multiple years. These tools aid in the verification and exploration of data, contributing to a deeper understanding of air pollution dynamics. The paper suggests that such visualizations can be enhanced with satellite imagery and geographical data to better assess the environmental impact and spatial distribution of pollutants, assisted by global analysis programs and visualization software like D3."

    "summary": "The primary aim of the Preliminary analysis block in this study is to conduct a comprehensive examination of the data to ensure its correctness and completeness, which is essential for reliable scientific inquiry. This methodological approach follows the classic 'observation–hypothesis–verification' sequence of the scientific method. In the spatial distribution analysis of $PM_{2.5}$ concentrations, specific focus is given to the months of January, February, November, and December. Notably, data shows higher $PM_{2.5}$ concentrations from Friday to Sunday between February and March compared to other times, indicating a potential temporal pattern in air pollution levels. This pattern forms the basis for the second hypothesis, suggesting there is a regular temporal pattern for air pollutants. Additionally, the study notes that heating may not be necessary as the climate is becoming warmer, which could influence pollution levels. The study also uses specific geographical markers, such as the blue star representing the US Embassy in the city center, for spatial analysis. Figure 9b illustrates 24-hour periods for selected years, which further supports the temporal analysis of air pollutants. The research underscores the importance of preliminary data validation and the application of scientific methodologies to derive valid conclusions about air quality patterns."

The research hypothesizes a correlation between air quality indices (AQI) of common pollutants such as PM2.5, PM10, NO<sup>2</sup>, and wind speed, as detailed in Section 2.2. This hypothesis is supported by findings of a strong correlation between these pollutants and wind speed, though precipitation shows a weak negative correlation with pollutant levels. Visual tools such as circular heat maps by year, month, and hour reveal the distribution of air pollution concentrations, capturing the severity and temporal variations across different periods. An interpolation heatmap further illustrates pollutant concentrations, with red indicating higher levels and blue indicating lower. Over the six-year study period, Beijing's average PM2.5 concentration exceeded the AQI threshold of 50, implicating a consistent pattern of moderate pollution that affects the local population. The satellite map in Figure 12, overlaid with 36 monitoring stations, illustrates the spatial distribution crucial for understanding regional pollution dynamics. Additionally, global patterns suggest a potential link between carbon dioxide concentrations and temperatures, hinting that controlling CO2 emissions could mitigate global warming."
