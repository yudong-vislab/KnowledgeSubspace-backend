In this research, we present many spatiotemporal datasets collected over Seoul city in Korea, which is currently much suffered by air pollution problem as well.

To the best of our knowledge, traffic volume and average driving speed data are two new datasets in air pollution research. In addition, recent research in air pollution has tried to build models to interpolate and predict air pollution in the city.

Furthermore, ConvLSTM model helps us to learn the spatial and temporal features of input data at the same time and automatically, surpassing recent research that much relied on hand-crafted spatiotemporal features. We will present in some next sections how we construct the input data to fit with ConvLSTM model and how to use it efficiently in air pollution relating problems.",

In fig. 8, we plot the output images of DAL, ConvLSTM, CNN Encoder-Decoder, and FC-LSTM model to see the distribution of air pollution interpolated values. Intuitively, FC-LSTM model shows the worst output with all the grid-cells except the existing monitoring stations have the same value. The reason is FC-LSTM networks do not learn the spatial features well, and thus do not give good interpolation output.

If the error is small then we can infer that other spatiotemporal data has a remarkable effect on air pollution interpolation. To measure the error, we alternately set the air pollution value of each existed input pixel to zero, keep other data of that pixel unchanged, running the trained model on this modified input data and calculate RMSE between the inferred value with the actual pixel value of the same position. The final error is the mean of all errors after doing this procedure with all existing air pollution values. We call this error spRMSE, which means the RMSE caused by spatiotemporal factors. The experiments results are shown in Table III. We can notice that ConvLSTM + Speed model has a better spRMSE than ConvLSTM in spite it has worse overall RMSE; which indicates the driving average speed affects air pollution in spatiotemporal form.

Lastly, we proposed a spatiotemporal Deep Learning based model for citywide air pollution interpolation and prediction. We proved that the proposed model does not only work better than CNN and LSTM themselves in spatial and temporal features analysis but also outperforms state-of-the-art relevant models. The leverage of using other spatiotemporal factors gives us a powerful model in interpolating and forecasting air pollution over the city.",

In this paper, we predict the air quality of next 48 hours for each monitoring station, considering air quality data, meteorology data, and weather forecast data. Based on the domain knowledge about air pollution, we propose a deep neural network (DNN)-based approach (entitled DeepAir), which consists of a spatial transformation component and a deep distributed fusion network. Considering air pollutants' spatial correlations, the former component converts the spatial sparse air quality data into a consistent input to simulate the pollutant sources. The latter network adopts a neural distributed architecture to fuse heterogeneous urban data for simultaneously capturing the factors affecting air quality, e.g. meteorological conditions. We deployed DeepAir in our AirPollutionPrediction system, providing fine-grained air quality forecasts for 300+ Chinese cities every hour. The experimental results on the data from three-year nine Chinese-city demonstrate the advantages of DeepAir beyond 10 baseline methods.

As air pollutants are dispersed in geographical space, the former component regards the readings recorded by air quality monitoring stations as second-hand pollutant sources. Considering air pollutants' spatial correlations, spatial transformation component uses the spatial partition, spatial aggregation, and spatial interpolation to convert the spatial sparse air quality data into a consistent input, named AQIs. Then, AQIs and other datasets, i.e. meteorology, weather forecast, other pollutants, time, and station ID are fed into deep distributed fusion network, which adapts DNN to fuse heterogeneous urban data. We first use embedding method to transform the raw features of each domain data into a low-dimensional space for capturing temporal correlation and learning the intra-dynamics. Here, we use the embedding of AQIs to simulate the direct factors from local emission and regional transport and use the embedding of rest datasets as indirect factors respectively. Then, we propose a distributed fusion architecture to simultaneously model the interactions between these factors for learning the individual and holistic influences. As each indirect factor has own effort on direct factors affecting future air quality, we build four subnets (HW, WF, SP, and MP) to capture the individual influences from the historical weather, weather forecast, secondary productions, and meta properties from time and terrain, respectively. Besides individual influences, we build a subnet (HI) to learn the holistic influence by fusing all direct and indirect factors together. After that, the outputs of five subnets are aggregated by weighted merge to capture the high-level effects of these factors. Finally, the aggregation is mapped into [0, 1] by a Sigmoid function to generate final prediction results.",

Thus, we fill the missing values in these regions shown in Figure 5(d). More specifically, we first random generate some fake monitoring stations in these regions. Then, we use a classic spatial interpolation method, inverse distance weighting (IDW) [11], to interpolate the AQI of fake monitoring stations. Considering the readings of geospatially adjacent stations located in both inside and outside the outer circle, IDW assigns a weight to each available reading of geospatially adjacent stations by the distance to target sensor, and then aggregates these weights and readings by weighted average. After that, we aggregate the interpolated values of fake stations to calculate average AQI for the region. Finally, we get 17 AQI in one timestamp which 1 AQI come from target station and 16 AQI come from neighbor regions. We conduct the same process for each monitoring stations along time.",

We have deployed DeepAir in AirPollutionPrediction system, providing fine-grained air quality forecasts for 300+ Chinese cities every hour.

The Po Valley region in northern Italy has been characterized as a hotspot for high aerosol loadings and frequent NPF events in southern Europe.

In this study, we conducted a continuous 2-month measurement campaign with stateof-the-art instruments to elucidate the NPF and growth mechanisms in northern Italy.

At the same time, NPF occurs frequently in the Po Valley (Hamed et al., 2007; Manninen et al., 2010). For example, Shen et al. (2021) observed that NPF events took place on approximately 70  $\\%$  of the days during spring and summer. Similarly, Kontkanen et al. (2017) discovered that NPF occurred on 89 % of the days during summer. During NPF event days, high formation rates of sub-2 nm neutral particles ( $J_2$ ,  $\\sim 10^1$  to  $10^2 \\text{ cm}^{-3} \\text{ s}^{-1}$ ; Kontkanen et al., 2017) and SA concentrations ( $\\sim 1 \\times 10^7 \\text{ cm}^{-3}$ ) were observed in the Po Valley (Paasonen et al., 2010; Kontkanen et al., 2017). These levels were among the highest recorded in a study conducted at nine sites across the Northern Hemisphere (Kontkanen et al., 2017).",

Certain alkaline molecules, including amines (e.g., dimethylamine \u2013 DMA) and ammonia (NH3) have been shown to substantially enhance nucleation and reduce evaporation by stabilizing atmospheric SA in chamber studies (Almeida et al., 2013). Furthermore, oxygenated organic molecules (OOMs) can also contribute to NPF and subsequent particle growth, even without the inclusion of SA (Kirkby et al., 2016; Xiao et al., 2021). As shown in Fig. 3a, most of the measurements were above the SA\u2013NH<sup>3</sup> system at 278 K from the CLOUD chamber, suggesting that the SA\u2013NH<sup>3</sup> mechanism itself cannot solely explain the measured J1.<sup>7</sup> and that other species are most likely participating in NPF in the Po Valley. For instance, amines, such as DMA or trimethylamine (TMA), with higher basicity may contribute to NPF, consistent with non-negligible concentrations of amines in previous studies in the aerosol at SPC (Paglione et al., 2014; Decesari et al., 2014). For the whole sampling period, the median SA and J1.<sup>7</sup> values in the Po Valley follow the SA\u2013DMA\u2013NH<sup>3</sup> (4 ppt DMA and 1 ppb NH3) and SA\u2013DMA\u2013NH3\u2013Org (adding additional oxidized aromatic organics; Xiao et al., 2021) lines from the CLOUD chamber at 293 K, even though the average noontime temperature was around 285 K during most of the NPF days (Fig. 3a).",

The values in parentheses represent the respective 25th and 75th percentiles of data (Fig. 3c). Growth rates increase with particle diameter, which is a phenomenon also observed in other campaigns around the world (Kontkanen et al., 2017; Kulmala et al., 2013), typically indicative of an increasing organic vapor contribution with size (e.g., Stolzenburg et al., 2018). The growth rates observed here were similar to those observed by Kontkanen et al. (2016) at SPC in summer (7.2 nm  $h^{-1}$  for 7\u201320 nm). Moreover, our 1.5\u2013 3 nm growth rate matches well with Manninen et al. (2010)  $(1.5 \\text{ nm h}^{-1})$  during spring in the Po Valley. A comparison to predicted growth rates from sulfuric acid condensation without organics, which was calculated based on kinetic collisions of the measured SA concentrations and the effect of van der Waals forces on the collision frequency (Stolzenburg et al., 2020), suggests that sulfuric acid condensation may be, on average, sufficient for the growth of the smallest clusters (Fig. 3c). This supports the argument that sulfuric acid and its stabilizing molecules (likely the bases, such as  $NH_3$  and amines) were controlling particle formation in the initial steps of NPF and growth in the Po Valley. However, for particles to grow beyond 3 nm in size, other vapors were needed, which was suggested by the significantly lower contribution of growth by SA (indicated by the green line) than the measured GR for  $3-7$  and  $7-15$  nm particles (Fig. 3c). Those vapors were likely a mixture of organics from anthropogenic and biogenic origins (with the latter emitted at higher rates during summer). We compared the GR during NPF with and without growth events using the method proposed in Kulmala et al.  $(2022)$ : the signal was averaged for all classified non-event days and an appearance time fit was then performed for each size channel independently, also revealing a growth pattern. We found no significant difference with respect to the GR in the  $7-15 \\text{ nm}$  size range for NPF with or without growth days ( $\\text{GR} = 5.1 \\text{ nm h}^{-1}$  for NPF with growth days and  $GR = 6.1 \\text{ nm h}^{-1}$  for NPF without growth days). Considering the similar CS and GR levels for NPF with and without growth days, the higher formation rates at  $1.7 \\text{ nm}$  ( $87 \\text{ cm}^{-3} \\text{ s}^{-1}$ ) may be a more important factor to surpass the CS. Under stable meteorological conditions, a higher formation rate may significantly elevate the possibility that newly formed particles overcome the CS and continuously grow to larger sizes.",

Through direct ion cluster measurement, kinetic models and comparison with the CLOUD chamber experiment, we have determined that sulfuric acid\u2013base nucleation is the dominant formation mechanism in the Po Valley region. Abundant sulfuric acid and alkaline molecules, including amines and ammonia derived from agriculture activities, provided ample precursors for NPF events. In contrast to megacity environments, the CS showed no significant difference between NPF event days and non-event days, indicating that it is more the abundance of precursors than the variations in the sink controlling the occurrence of NPF in the Po Valley. Furthermore, we observed that, apart from DMA, a typical basic precursor, NH<sup>3</sup> and other amines were also likely to be involved in NPF in the Po Valley. This was supported by the high abundance of SA\u2013NH<sup>3</sup> and SA\u2013NH3\u2013amine clusters measured by the APi-ToF during NPF events. DMA, while more efficient than ammonia, was insufficient to stabilize all SA during our sampling period. This resulted in a more scattered correlation between sulfuric acid concentrations and measured formation rates compared with Chinese megacities. In that sense, we could show that the clustering during NPF is clearly distinct between polluted megacity environments and polluted semi-urbanized regions such as the Po Valley. Similar to Beijing, we found that OOMs did not play a decisive role in initial cluster formation, likely due to the absence of ultra-low-volatility organics (typical OOM dimers) in the ion and neutral cluster measurements. However, low-volatility organics were abundant enough to induce fast growth processes above 3 nm. The comparable GRs and formation rates, along with the lower efficient CS compared with megacity environments, indicate a high survival probability for the newly formed particles. Therefore, NPF is likely to play an important role in the fine-particle concentrations and pollution levels in the Po Valley region. Further reductions in key NPF species, including SO2, amines and NH3, can contribute to suppressing the NPF event frequency and lowering particle numbers.

For example, nitroaromatic compounds (Laskin et al., 2015; Xie et al., 2017) and imidazole-like species (Bones et al., 2010; Li et al., 2019) are typical brown carbon molecules that absorb solar radiation, leading to a warming effect. Amines are more efficient than ammonia (NH3) in reacting with sulfuric acid to form new particles (Qiu et al., 2011), even in urban regions with high aerosol loading (Yao et al., 2018). Nitro-polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (nitro-PAHs) are known toxicants to the human body (Miller-Schulze et al., 2010; Bandowe and Meusel, 2017). Additionally, the atmospheric deposition of organic nitrogen (ON) species serves as a significant source of N nutrient for marine and remote continental regions (Kielland et al., 2006; Andersen et al., 2017; Li et al., 2023).

However, the elemental analyzers' detection limit of nitrogen is insufficient for accurate measurements of trace-level aerosol nitrogen (Duan et al., 2009), limiting its widespread use in aerosol nitrogen analysis.

Second, the quantification of both WSON and WION using the difference method introduces considerable uncertainty, especially when ON is a minor fraction of TN (Yu et al., 2021).

The measurement principle and operational procedure of the TAG system have been described in detail in previous studies (Williams et al., 2006; He et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2021). In brief, the TAG system operated at a time resolution of 2 h. During the first hour, ambient air was drawn through a  $PM_{2.5}$  cyclone at a flow rate of  $10 \\text{ L min}^{-1}$ , passing through a carbon denuder to remove the gas phase, and particles were then collected onto a thermal desorption cell (CTD). In the second hour, the collected particles underwent thermal desorption and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. In each analysis, 5 \u00b5L of an internal standard mixture was added to the CTD that was loaded with particles collected in the preceding hour. During the thermal desorption step, the polar organic compounds in the  $PM_{2.5}$  were derivatized to their trimethylsilyl derivatives under a helium stream saturated with the derivatization agent Nmethyl-N-(trimethylsilyl) trifluoroacetamide (MSTFA). Subsequently, the organic compounds were reconcentrated onto a focusing trap cooled by a fan. Following this, the CTD was purged with pure helium to remove excess MSTFA, and the focusing trap was heated to  $330\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  to transfer the organic compounds into the valveless injection system, which utilizes a restrictive capillary tube to connect to the GC inlet. The GC-MS analysis was then initiated. A total of approximately 100 polar and non-polar organic compounds could be identified and quantified with authentic standards (Zhu et al., 2021).

Among the primary sources, coal combustion and vehicle emissions were the most dominant, each contributing 21 % to the aerosol ON. This finding was consistent with the summertime measurements at the same site that vehicle emissions and coal combustion dominated the primary emission sources of ON (Yu et al., 2023). The contribution of coal combustion to ON was higher during nighttime, whereas the contribution of vehicle emissions increased during traffic rush hours (Fig. 2c). In comparison, industrial and dust emissions had relatively lower contributions to ON but showed increased contributions during daytime. Biomass burning has been recognized as an important source of aerosol ON (Mace et al., 2003; Chen and Chen, 2010; Yu et al., 2017). In this study, we found that a negligible fraction of ON was apportioned to the primary biomass burning factor while a notable presence (7.2 %) of ON in the factor of nitrocatechol formation processes (Fig. 2). Nitrocatechols are probably formed through the nitration of catechols emitted from biomass burning. This secondary formation pathway was supported by the good correlation between levoglucosan and nitrocatechols (Fig. S7). The contribution of primary cooking emissions to ON was generally low, averaging 2 % across the observation period.

The apparent allocation of biogenically derived organic nitrates to the nitrate formation factor may reflect differences in the formation mechanisms of organic nitrates versus those of traditional biogenic SOA tracers.",

This oxidized ON accounted for 4 %-68 % (25 % on average) of the total oxidized N (oxidized ON plus nitrate-N) (Fig. S10b). Both oxidized ON and inorganic nitrate are formed from nitrogen oxides  $(NO_x)$ , indicating shared precursors and partially overlapping formation pathways. Our results suggest that, under urban atmospheric conditions, the conversion ratio of  $NO_x$ -N to aerosol-phase ON and nitrate-N is approximately  $1:3$ . While this estimate is subject to uncertainties inherent in source apportionment and chemical transformation processes, it provides valuable for evaluating the fate of  $NO_x$  and its partitioning into organic and inorganic aerosol nitrogen.

This fraction of SON may indicate the formation of organic nitrates, which share common precursor of  $NO_x$  with nitrate. Organic nitrates have long been recognized as notable components of secondary OAs in ambient air (Rollins et al., 2012; Perring et al., 2013). Organic nitrate formation encompasses two main pathways: hydroxyl radical (OH)-initiated oxidation of hydrocarbons in the presence of  $NO_x$  during the day and nitrate radical ( $NO_3$ )-initiated oxidation of alkenes during the night. Both pathways involve the formation of organic nitrates in the gas phase, followed by partitioning to the particulate phase (Perring et al., 2013). This study, through integrated analyses of SON and SOC, provides evidence suggesting that organic nitrates might also form through heterogeneous or aqueous reactions. As depicted in Fig. 4, the nitrate formation process produced  $0.17 \\,\\mu\\text{g N m}^{-3}$  of  $\\Delta\\text{SON}$  and  $0.43 \\,\\mu\\text{g C m}^{-3}$  of  $\\Delta\\text{SOC}$  from the night of 20 December to the following morning, yielding a  $\\Delta$ SOC /  $\\Delta$ SON atomic ratio of only 2.9. Gas-phase formation of organic nitrates followed by gas-to-particle partitioning would not result in such a low  $C/N$  ratio. Therefore, a large number of organic nitrates might be formed through heterogeneous or aqueous reactions between organic compounds and  $\\text{HNO}_3 / \\text{NO}_3$ , enhancing the ON content while not affecting the OC content which is already present in the particle phase. In a previous study, it was suggested that organic nitrates can be produced through non-radical reactions of hydrated glyoxal and nitric acid in the aqueous phase (Lim et al., 2016). Xu et al. (2020) found that aerosol liquid water promotes the formation of water-soluble ON, probably in the form of organic nitrate species. Previous studies have identified an 80 % underestimation of monoterpene hydroxyl nitrate by the GEOS-Chem model, which considers both OH oxidation and  $NO_3$  oxidation mechanisms of monoterpene (Li et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2021), indicating an incomplete understanding of the formation mechanisms of organic nitrates. Our observational results, combined with previous investigations, suggest the need for further exploration of the formation mechanisms of particulate organic nitrates, such as heterogeneous/aqueous phase reaction processes.",

        "paragraph_info": "Four Type 5 cases were identified, each characterized with nitrate formation processing as the driving source for the increase in SON. This fraction of SON may indicate the formation of organic nitrates, which share common precursor of  $NO_x$  with nitrate. Organic nitrates have long been recognized as notable components of secondary OAs in ambient air (Rollins et al., 2012; Perring et al., 2013). Organic nitrate formation encompasses two main pathways: hydroxyl radical (OH)-initiated oxidation of hydrocarbons in the presence of  $NO_x$  during the day and nitrate radical ( $NO_3$ )-initiated oxidation of alkenes during the night. Both pathways involve the formation of organic nitrates in the gas phase, followed by partitioning to the particulate phase (Perring et al., 2013). This study, through integrated analyses of SON and SOC, provides evidence suggesting that organic nitrates might also form through heterogeneous or aqueous reactions. As depicted in Fig. 4, the nitrate formation process produced  $0.17 \\,\\mu\\text{g N m}^{-3}$  of  $\\Delta\\text{SON}$  and  $0.43 \\,\\mu\\text{g C m}^{-3}$  of  $\\Delta\\text{SOC}$  from the night of 20 December to the following morning, yielding a  $\\Delta$ SOC /  $\\Delta$ SON atomic ratio of only 2.9. Gas-phase formation of organic nitrates followed by gas-to-particle partitioning would not result in such a low  $C/N$  ratio. Therefore, a large number of organic nitrates might be formed through heterogeneous or aqueous reactions between organic compounds and  $\\text{HNO}_3 / \\text{NO}_3$ , enhancing the ON content while not affecting the OC content which is already present in the particle phase. In a previous study, it was suggested that organic nitrates can be produced through non-radical reactions of hydrated glyoxal and nitric acid in the aqueous phase (Lim et al., 2016). Xu et al. (2020) found that aerosol liquid water promotes the formation of water-soluble ON, probably in the form of organic nitrate species. Previous studies have identified an 80 % underestimation of monoterpene hydroxyl nitrate by the GEOS-Chem model, which considers both OH oxidation and  $NO_3$  oxidation mechanisms of monoterpene (Li et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2021), indicating an incomplete understanding of the formation mechanisms of organic nitrates. Our observational results, combined with previous investigations, suggest the need for further exploration of the formation mechanisms of particulate organic nitrates, such as heterogeneous/aqueous phase reaction processes.",

To analyze the propagation of air pollution, state-of-the-art approach HYSPLIT [52] was put forward in the environmental science literature. This approach was proposed to automatically infer how pollutants are dispersed in the atmosphere and affect an area. Although the potential pollution sources are identified for the given area, HYSPLIT considers neither a) the inherent uncertainties in the dynamic propagation patterns nor b) the complex district-level interactions among multiple cities.

The large sizes of the inner orange circles suggested that these two districts were seriously polluted. Moreover, the pie charts in Fig. [1C](#page-0-0)5 and [1C](#page-0-0)6 indicated that the pollution propagated along two different paths was largely contributed by the pollution in these two districts, which were constantly exposed to the pollution from Shijiazhuang. EA and EB hypothesized that the coal-fired power plants could be a severe air pollution source that had a considerable impact on remote regions. This hypothesis needs to be confirmed with advanced chemical reaction analysis. Moreover, EC also indicated that the pollution in Shijiazhuang might reach northeastern districts, including Beijing and Langfang, via these two paths. Therefore, informed pollution control policies can be made with these patterns, such as suspending a few power plants in Shijiazhuang based on the forecasted wind conditions, which has been proven to be particularly effective [\\[54\\]](#page-10-27).",

Therefore, this study proposed an efficient visualization method to represent directly, quickly, and clearly the spatio-temporal information contained in air pollution data. Data quality check and cleansing during a preliminary visual analysis is presented in tabular form, heat matrix, or line chart, upon which hypotheses can be deduced. Further visualizations were designed to verify the hypotheses and obtain useful findings. This method was tested and validated in a year-long case study of the air quality index (AQI of PM2.5) in Beijing, China. We found that PM2.5, PM10, and NO<sup>2</sup> may be emitted by the same sources, and strong winds may accelerate the spread of pollutants. The average concentration of PM2.5 in Beijing was greater than the AQI value of 50 over the six-year study period. Furthermore, arable lands exhibited considerably higher concentrations of air pollutants than vegetation-covered areas. The findings of this study showed that our visualization method is intuitive and reliable through data quality checking and information sharing with multi-perspective air pollution graphs. This method allows the data to be easily understood by the public and inspire or aid further studies in other fields.",

Strong winds will accelerate the spread of pollutants, and a mixture of fresh air may decrease pollutant concentration. Moreover, precipitation has a weak negative correlation with the pollutants. Precipitation can wash the PM<sub>2.5</sub>, which can be replenished very soon in Beijing.
