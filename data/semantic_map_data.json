The first step involves encoding visual features from medical images into a structured abnormality graph that informs subsequent processes. These domain-informed requirements are crucial as they lay the foundation for both the system pipeline and the interaction design, ensuring that the generated reports meet professional standards. The *Filtering Panel* plays a key role by offering initial parameter filters, case selection options, and clustering parameters to streamline the analysis. Cropped inputs, compared to entire frames, facilitate the formation of more compact clusters and clearer trajectory convergence, which is observed when using UMAP for dimensionality reduction and clustering via DBSCAN. The trajectory convergence radius, defined as r_i = (1/K) ∑_{t=t_i-K+1}^{t_i} ||p_i(t) - overline{p_i}||, helps quantify how trajectory points cluster over time. This precise clustering is instrumental in retrieving the top-k most similar cases based on similarity scores, aiding in effective case triaging or grouping, even in scenarios involving hundreds of cases. The system's user interface allows for interactive functionalities such as zoom, pan, and tooltips, enhancing user engagement and comprehension of data.

These modes include cavity shear-layer stabilized combustion, cavity assisted jet-wake stabilized combustion, and a combined cavity shear-layer/recirculation stabilized combustion. An experiment conducted by Aguilera et al. examined the scram-to-ram transition using fin-guided injection upstream of the cavity under conditions where the hydrogen fuel, injected into the cavity at Mach 1, is at an ambient temperature of 295 K. The setup involves fuel orifices situated 25 mm downstream of the cavity step. The combustion process is influenced by the mass diffusivity characterized by the molecular Schmidt number. Cavity shear-layer experiences severe flow oscillations, with the most OH radicals concentrated here. At the rear of the shear-layer, a recirculation zone provides radicals and heat to the downstream flame, while hydrogen accumulates at the cavity corner to sustain the upstream flame. Despite flow oscillations, the cavity assisted jet-wake mode is inferred. Subsonic flow peaks and combustion mode transitions are intertwined, often leading to transient flow separations. During the first stage, swing flames result from jet/shear-layer interactions, while the pressure in the cavity increases rapidly. In the subsequent stages, pressure stabilizes, but significant oscillations occur, culminating in stage three, marked by intensive heat release and a large vortex at the cavity exit. This vortex entrains the flame into the cavity floor causing a substantial flame amplitude during this combustion process.",

The stoichiometric mixture fraction, Zst, was determined to be 0.0219, aiding in the analysis of flame behavior. The rich-premixed regime was notably observed near the fuel jet, while the flame in case 1 was located either inside the cavity or near the upper wall of the expansion section. Beyond x = 175 mm, the supersonic downstream flow ratio initially increased but subsequently dropped to a minimum of 43% at the thermal throat. This dynamic was captured in contours of MFI, with black isolines marking stoichiometry. During mode #2, the flame oscillated at the cavity step height, and snapshots indicated a strengthening of thermal choking as the flame oscillated near the lower wall, especially evident in stage #3. The lack of a cavity recirculation zone in ram mode caused the jet-wake flame to oscillate with the separated flow and led to a reduction in the fuel jet's penetration depth. The most energetic proper orthogonal mode (POM), mode #1, was closely aligned with the dominant flame mode. In scram mode, the subsonic recirculation rate peaked at 1.6% at the cavity recirculation core.

A cavity measuring 121 mm in length and 11 mm in depth, with a rear-wall-expansion angle of β = 21.1°, is installed on the upper wall, affecting the flow dynamics. Under conditions where the supersonic flow dominates, it helps to minimize energy losses at high flight Mach numbers. However, the system is prone to flow instabilities due to factors such as self-sustained cavity shear-layer oscillations, unsteady jets in supersonic crossflows, and separated boundary layers. Notably, the cavity's design, characterized by a large length-to-depth ratio (L/D = 11), lacks a primary recirculation zone, likely due to interactions between the fuel jet and low-speed separated flow. This configuration contributes to a tendency towards cavity flame blowout, exacerbating combustion instabilities during mode transitions. High-frequency oscillations in pressure, along with multiple reciprocating oscillations and flame flashback phenomena, were observed. The downstream vortex significantly influences flame oscillation characteristics, with vortex interactions maintaining overall flame stability rather than streamwise transport. Local flow behavior, such as the subsonic upstream flow peaking at x = 200 mm and downstream flow peaking at 10% at x = 190 mm, delineates the cavity-recirculation core and other high-pressure zones, crucial for understanding the dynamics of mode transitions in the combustor.",

Meanwhile, Kato et al. conducted experimental research to further explore this transition. Various methods have been suggested to accurately determine the operating mode of the DMSJ engine, with one key focus being on the flame behavior and dynamics. The current study introduces a Modified Flame Index (MFI), which includes the unit-volume heat-release rate as a new parameter for analysis. For instance, a volume-averaged heat-release rate of HRR = 2 × 10^8 W/m^3 is used, and this distribution is depicted alongside the instantaneous heat-release rate contour for enhanced analysis. Additionally, it has been noted that the temperature in the cavity is significantly higher than in other test cases. Furthermore, large-amplitude oscillations stemming from cycles of pressurization and depressurization are observed, and the study suggests that these low-frequency oscillations can potentially be mitigated through the optimization of the combustor's dimensional parameters.

          "summary": "The study investigates the dynamics within a Dual-Mode Scramjet (DMSJ) engine, focusing on how intensive heat release impacts the inflow conditions via large-scale flow separation caused by upstream-propagating backpressure. The research employs the HLLC-P Riemann solver, which is suitable across a spectrum of flow regimes, from hypersonic compressible to low-speed incompressible flows. Key features of the isolator include an 80 mm expansion section with a divergent angle of α = 1.4°, where the air inlet velocity profile is mapped 50 mm downstream. Experimental and computational pressure profiles are compared, revealing that reflected and pre-combustion shock waves cause a lower measured pressure on the upper wall than the cross-section average. The study categorizes approaches based on the significant pressure-rise point relative to the isolator exit, noting that in case 1, the leading edge of the cavity is the origin of reflected shocks, propagating pressure rise upstream to the isolator. This behavior is attributed to the dilution effect of a downstream-developing rich-mixture. The study further examines pressure and flame evolution during mode transition, emphasizing that during the critical stage (stage #3), the isolator experiences long-term, large-amplitude pressure responses. The flame is particularly vulnerable to the combined influences of large-scale separation vortexes and the fuel jet. The Mach number evolution shows that subsonic region distribution significantly affects flame movement. Time-averaged mass flow ratios of combined speed and direction are also considered, enhancing the understanding of the complex interactions during transition.",

As the oscillation period progresses, particularly during the maximum oscillation period from 3.05 ms to 4.45 ms (mode #3), the system experiences a transition marked on Snapshot 'D' from stable combustion to an unsteady transitional mode, eventually forming a jet-wake flame. The flame remains vulnerable to intermittent flameout due to large-amplitude shear-layer oscillations, even during severe shear-layer oscillations. During the second stage, unsteady heat release triggers high-frequency flame flashback. Despite these instabilities, the flame might still revert to a cavity mode under certain conditions.

          "summary": "The study investigates the flame stabilization mechanism within a cavity-floor direct-injection scramjet by employing various experimental and modeling approaches. The filtered reaction rate is modeled using the Partially Stirred Reactor (PaSR) model to provide insight into the combustion dynamics under specific conditions. The inflow of high-enthalpy vitiated air is accelerated to Mach 2 at the isolator entry, starting from stagnation conditions of 0.82 MPa and 950 K, with isentropic flow assumptions used to convert these into static values. Two cases with different global equivalence ratios (ER = 0.1 and ER = 0.3) were studied by varying the fuel jet's injection stagnation pressure (1.5 MPa and 4.0 MPa). Flame structure images demonstrate that the combustion stabilization mode is influenced by vortex dynamics and shock wave interactions, showing hairpin-like vortexes from shock/boundary-layer interactions and a counter-rotating vortex pair affecting shear-layer oscillations. Schlieren photography could not fully capture vortex evolution due to long exposure times, but differential interferometry highlights large-amplitude flow oscillations. There is significant dynamic behavior with the flame tail frequently switching between attachment and detachment from the cavity's trailing edge, leading to severe wrinkling and nearly downstream detachment of the flame.",

The study features a 30 mm entry through which air dynamically balances with the combustor's pressure, ensuring stable operation. Multiscale turbulence is captured, especially at the expansion fan, due to local mesh refinement, highlighting complex interactions within the flow. Computational comparisons of pressure profiles on the upper wall, validated against experimental data by Tian, reveal critical insights into the pressure evolution and boundary layer behavior. The separated flow distorts the flame leading edge, occasionally causing flashback. Observations indicate that the boundary layer separates due to an adverse pressure gradient when shock waves move upstream, reattaching when normal shock forms at the separation point downstream. Additionally, vortices within the flow, specifically vortices #2 and #3, gradually merge and enlarge further downstream, delineating the intricate nature of flow interactions in the system.",

The first step involves encoding visual features from medical images into a structured abnormality graph that informs subsequent processes. These domain-informed requirements are crucial as they lay the foundation for both the system pipeline and the interaction design, ensuring that the generated reports meet professional standards. The *Filtering Panel* plays a key role by offering initial parameter filters, case selection options, and clustering parameters to streamline the analysis. Cropped inputs, compared to entire frames, facilitate the formation of more compact clusters and clearer trajectory convergence, which is observed when using UMAP for dimensionality reduction and clustering via DBSCAN. The trajectory convergence radius, defined as r_i = (1/K) ∑_{t=t_i-K+1}^{t_i} ||p_i(t) - overline{p_i}||, helps quantify how trajectory points cluster over time. This precise clustering is instrumental in retrieving the top-k most similar cases based on similarity scores, aiding in effective case triaging or grouping, even in scenarios involving hundreds of cases. The system's user interface allows for interactive functionalities such as zoom, pan, and tooltips, enhancing user engagement and comprehension of data. Moreover, the developed semantic report generation mechanism is valuable for facilitating communication across experts, despite inherent subjectivities introduced in cluster centroid annotation.

These modes include cavity shear-layer stabilized combustion, cavity assisted jet-wake stabilized combustion, and a combined cavity shear-layer/recirculation stabilized combustion. An experiment conducted by Aguilera et al. examined the scram-to-ram transition using fin-guided injection upstream of the cavity under conditions where the hydrogen fuel, injected into the cavity at Mach 1, is at an ambient temperature of 295 K. The setup involves fuel orifices situated 25 mm downstream of the cavity step. The combustion process is influenced by the mass diffusivity characterized by the molecular Schmidt number. Cavity shear-layer experiences severe flow oscillations, with the most OH radicals concentrated here. At the rear of the shear-layer, a recirculation zone provides radicals and heat to the downstream flame, while hydrogen accumulates at the cavity corner to sustain the upstream flame. Despite flow oscillations, the cavity assisted jet-wake mode is inferred. Subsonic flow peaks and combustion mode transitions are intertwined, often leading to transient flow separations. During the first stage, swing flames result from jet/shear-layer interactions, while the pressure in the cavity increases rapidly. In the subsequent stages, pressure stabilizes, but significant oscillations occur, culminating in stage three, marked by intensive heat release and a large vortex at the cavity exit. This vortex entrains the flame into the cavity floor causing a substantial flame amplitude during this combustion process.",

The stoichiometric mixture fraction, Zst, was determined to be 0.0219, aiding in the analysis of flame behavior. The rich-premixed regime was notably observed near the fuel jet, while the flame in case 1 was located either inside the cavity or near the upper wall of the expansion section. Beyond x = 175 mm, the supersonic downstream flow ratio initially increased but subsequently dropped to a minimum of 43% at the thermal throat. This dynamic was captured in contours of MFI, with black isolines marking stoichiometry. During mode #2, the flame oscillated at the cavity step height, and snapshots indicated a strengthening of thermal choking as the flame oscillated near the lower wall, especially evident in stage #3. The lack of a cavity recirculation zone in ram mode caused the jet-wake flame to oscillate with the separated flow and led to a reduction in the fuel jet's penetration depth. The most energetic proper orthogonal mode (POM), mode #1, was closely aligned with the dominant flame mode. In scram mode, the subsonic recirculation rate peaked at 1.6% at the cavity recirculation core. This comprehensive investigation sheds light on the complex interactions between flame structures and flow regimes within various operational modes.",

A cavity measuring 121 mm in length and 11 mm in depth, with a rear-wall-expansion angle of β = 21.1°, is installed on the upper wall, affecting the flow dynamics. Under conditions where the supersonic flow dominates, it helps to minimize energy losses at high flight Mach numbers. However, the system is prone to flow instabilities due to factors such as self-sustained cavity shear-layer oscillations, unsteady jets in supersonic crossflows, and separated boundary layers. Notably, the cavity's design, characterized by a large length-to-depth ratio (L/D = 11), lacks a primary recirculation zone, likely due to interactions between the fuel jet and low-speed separated flow. This configuration contributes to a tendency towards cavity flame blowout, exacerbating combustion instabilities during mode transitions. High-frequency oscillations in pressure, along with multiple reciprocating oscillations and flame flashback phenomena, were observed. The downstream vortex significantly influences flame oscillation characteristics, with vortex interactions maintaining overall flame stability rather than streamwise transport. Local flow behavior, such as the subsonic upstream flow peaking at x = 200 mm and downstream flow peaking at 10% at x = 190 mm, delineates the cavity-recirculation core and other high-pressure zones, crucial for understanding the dynamics of mode transitions in the combustor.",

A notable experiment by Tian provided critical data for comparing computational pressure profiles, notably on the upper wall of the scramjet, validating the model's accuracy. The study reveals that severe flashback phenomena are significantly linked to disturbances in the jet impacting the shear layer under conditions of increased penetrability.

These oscillations were analyzed through the temporal histories of flame flashback distance, revealing fluctuations in the flame's position over time. In their study, they worked with a high-enthalpy vitiated air comprising 21% O2, 12% H2O, and 67% N2. A numerical simulation involved a computational domain with 342 × 80 × 38 cells within the cavity, which illustrated that the thermal expansion intensified vortex structures, leading to a more distributed high-temperature zone. Despite these conditions, a stable primary recirculation zone in the cavity was absent during ram mode operation, as indicated by the lower recirculation ratio in the corner recirculation zone compared to the separation zone. The fine structure within the flow, characterized by *κ*, was defined by the chemical time-scale *τ<sup>c</sup>* and the SGS mixing time-scale *τm*. Furthermore, vortex shedding showed the dual capability of either promoting or inhibiting the fuel jet's disintegration, playing a crucial role in the jet/cavity dynamics.

Their study emphasized the significant impact of airflow conditions and the jet to crossflow pressure ratio on the transition process apart from the injection strategy. By varying the injection pressure, Yan et al. further analyzed the transition processes between scram and ram modes. To simulate the fully-developed inflow, synthetic turbulence with a 5% fluctuation intensity was introduced using the LEMOS generator, following a 1/7th power law. The entrainment of cold hydrogen led to a temperature variation between the cavity's front and rear sections. Visual data revealed time-averaged distributions of velocity vectors with streamwise components, superimposed by instantaneous heat-release rate contours and an iso-surface of Y_H2 = 0.1, differentiating cavity recirculation and local extinction in one case from non-recirculation and corner recirculation zones in another. Observations noted subsonic upstream flow peaks within the engine at distinct locations, with a normal shock evident at the cavity entrance. During mode transition, streamwise velocity and Mach number snapshots captured the decay of cavity recirculation and the establishment of thermal choke. The pressure response in the isolator tail illustrated upstream propagation of backpressure. At one snapshot, a shedding vortex collided with the cavity's rear-wall. This upstream vortex interacted with the fuel jet, affecting the jet's penetration depth periodically, and was generated by a sudden contraction entering the expansion section.",

Meanwhile, Kato et al. conducted experimental research to further explore this transition. Various methods have been suggested to accurately determine the operating mode of the DMSJ engine, with one key focus being on the flame behavior and dynamics. The current study introduces a Modified Flame Index (MFI), which includes the unit-volume heat-release rate as a new parameter for analysis. For instance, a volume-averaged heat-release rate of HRR = 2 × 10^8 W/m^3 is used, and this distribution is depicted alongside the instantaneous heat-release rate contour for enhanced analysis. Additionally, it has been noted that the temperature in the cavity is significantly higher than in other test cases. Furthermore, large-amplitude oscillations stemming from cycles of pressurization and depressurization are observed, and the study suggests that these low-frequency oscillations can potentially be mitigated through the optimization of the combustor's dimensional parameters.

The research employs the HLLC-P Riemann solver, which is suitable across a spectrum of flow regimes, from hypersonic compressible to low-speed incompressible flows. Key features of the isolator include an 80 mm expansion section with a divergent angle of α = 1.4°, where the air inlet velocity profile is mapped 50 mm downstream. Experimental and computational pressure profiles are compared, revealing that reflected and pre-combustion shock waves cause a lower measured pressure on the upper wall than the cross-section average. The study categorizes approaches based on the significant pressure-rise point relative to the isolator exit, noting that in case 1, the leading edge of the cavity is the origin of reflected shocks, propagating pressure rise upstream to the isolator. This behavior is attributed to the dilution effect of a downstream-developing rich-mixture. The study further examines pressure and flame evolution during mode transition, emphasizing that during the critical stage (stage #3), the isolator experiences long-term, large-amplitude pressure responses. The flame is particularly vulnerable to the combined influences of large-scale separation vortexes and the fuel jet. The Mach number evolution shows that subsonic region distribution significantly affects flame movement.

Once the heat release reaches a sufficient level, significant unsteadiness is observed. In these conditions, the jet-wake flame prevails, contributing substantially to the heat release, although there is a negligible presence of OH radicals at the cavity leading edge. As the oscillation period progresses, particularly during the maximum oscillation period from 3.05 ms to 4.45 ms (mode #3), the system experiences a transition marked on Snapshot 'D' from stable combustion to an unsteady transitional mode, eventually forming a jet-wake flame. The flame remains vulnerable to intermittent flameout due to large-amplitude shear-layer oscillations, even during severe shear-layer oscillations. During the second stage, unsteady heat release triggers high-frequency flame flashback. Despite these instabilities, the flame might still revert to a cavity mode under certain conditions.

However, the large scale and high dimensionality of simulation-generated temporal flow field data present significant challenges for visual interpretation, feature differentiation, and cross-case comparison. In this paper, we present TemporalFlowViz, a parameter-aware visual analytics workflow and system designed to support expert-driven clustering, visualization, and interpretation of temporal flow fields from scramjet combustion simulations. Our approach leverages hundreds of simulated combustion cases with varying initial conditions, each producing time-sequenced flow field images. We use pretrained Vision Transformers to extract high-dimensional embeddings from these frames, apply dimensionality reduction and density-based clustering to uncover latent combustion modes, and construct temporal trajectories in the embedding space to track the evolution of each simulation over time. To bridge the gap between latent representations and expert reasoning, domain specialists annotate representative cluster centroids with descriptive labels. These annotations are used as contextual prompts for a vision–language model, which generates natural-language summaries for individual frames and full simulation cases. The system also supports parameter-based filtering, similarity-based case retrieval, and coordinated multi-view exploration to facilitate in-depth analysis. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TemporalFlowViz through two expert-informed case studies and expert feedback, showing TemporalFlowViz enhances hypothesis generation, supports interpretable pattern discovery, and enhances knowledge discovery in large-scale scramjet combustion analysis.",

By varying the injection pressure, Yan et al. [\\[8\\]](#page-11-0) compared the transition processes from scram to ram and from ram to scram. The results revealed that the transition from ram to scram was more challenging than from scram to ram, and the shock waves were still in the isolator when the combustor entered scram mode. Also, a lot of effort has been put into studying the mechanisms that stabilize combustion [\\[5,9](#page-11-0)–[11\\]](#page-11-0). Three common stabilization modes may be distinguished [\\[9](#page-11-0)] based on where the flame anchors: cavity shear-layer stabilized combustion, cavity assisted jet-wake stabilized combustion, and combined cavity shear-layer/recirculation stabilized combustion. The correlation between operating and stabilization modes of the DMSJ combustor was further investigated by Yuan et al. [\\[10\\]](#page-11-0), who observed that the flame was stabilized in the cavity shear-layer at scram mode while in the jet-wake at ram mode.",

The downstream flame receives radicals and a hot environment from the cavity recirculation zone, which is located at the rear of the shear-layer. This process is known as cavity shear-layer stabilized combustion. The cold jet penetrates the shear-layer and causes local extinction, in contrast to the outcomes of injection upstream of the cavity [\\[9\\]](#page-11-0). But the whole flame remains stable, since it is mainly held by the vortex interactions with the cavity rather than the streamwise transportation. In case 2, a significant corner recirculation zone is also generated. Nevertheless, its jet momentum is higher and the recirculation velocity is lower than in case 1. In order to prevent hydrogen from being heavily entrained into the corner, hot products collect instead, acting as an ignitor. It is important to note that the cavity lacks a primary recirculation zone, which may be the result of interactions between the fuel jet and low-speed separated flow in a configuration with a large length to depth ratio (L/D = 11). Similarly, it can be inferred as cavity assisted jet-wake stabilized combustion, though it is susceptible to the flow oscillation.",

However, the large scale and high dimensionality of simulation-generated temporal flow field data present significant challenges for visual interpretation, feature differentiation, and cross-case comparison. In this paper, we present TemporalFlowViz, a parameter-aware visual analytics workflow and system designed to support expert-driven clustering, visualization, and interpretation of temporal flow fields from scramjet combustion simulations. Our approach leverages hundreds of simulated combustion cases with varying initial conditions, each producing time-sequenced flow field images. We use pretrained Vision Transformers to extract high-dimensional embeddings from these frames, apply dimensionality reduction and density-based clustering to uncover latent combustion modes, and construct temporal trajectories in the embedding space to track the evolution of each simulation over time. To bridge the gap between latent representations and expert reasoning, domain specialists annotate representative cluster centroids with descriptive labels. These annotations are used as contextual prompts for a vision–language model, which generates natural-language summaries for individual frames and full simulation cases. The system also supports parameter-based filtering, similarity-based case retrieval, and coordinated multi-view exploration to facilitate in-depth analysis. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TemporalFlowViz through two expert-informed case studies and expert feedback, showing TemporalFlowViz enhances hypothesis generation, supports interpretable pattern discovery, and enhances knowledge discovery in large-scale scramjet combustion analysis.",

In mode #2, a similar but larger counter-rotating vortex pair is generated, and the upstream vortex extends to the tail of the isolator. Mode #3 embodies the coherent structures that are related to the largest-amplitude flame oscillation. A single large vortex can be observed at the cavity exit, which occupies the entire height and entrains the flame into the cavity floor, consistent with the previous analyses. The vortex is generated by the sudden contraction of the channel when entering the expansion section. Therefore, it is expected that low-frequency oscillations of this kind can be suppressed by optimizing the dimensional parameters of the combustor.",
