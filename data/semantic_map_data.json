The unsteadiness of the flame can be present locally or globally in supersonic combustion, for instance, reactant mixing, ignition, flame stabilization, and blow-off. Thus, unsteady supersonic combustion is an urgent problem that needs to be solved for real scramjet engine applications. This work helps to advance the knowledge of dual-mode scramjet combustion operating with different equivalence ratios by conducting quantitative analyses that characterize flame dynamics under flow separation. A hydrogenfueled direct-injection scheme was computed using *blastFoam* code via large-eddy simulation of a scramjet test rig at a stagnation temperature of 950 K and a pressure of 0.82 MPa. The computational results were in good agreement with the experimental data, and two typical flame structures (cavity shear-layer and cavity assisted jet-wake stabilized flame) corresponding to the scram/ram operating modes were reproduced. The local flame structure and flow regime were investigated using a modified flame index and filter functions. A particular focus was set on the continuous flame flashback during mode transition, which could be divided into three stages involving jet/shear-layer interaction, unsteady heat release, and the establishment of a large-area separation zone, with the decay of the cavity recirculation zone. Additionally, the unsteady jet-wake ram combustion presented three oscillation modes, giving rise to intermittent flameout of varying levels. The coherent-structures motion caused by the combined effects of low-speed separated flow and the fuel-jet was the main cause for this kind of unsteady combustion."

The paper is structured as follows: The next section describes the methodology and quantitative comparison. After that a phenomenological description of flame stabilization mechanism is presented following a comprehensive analysis of the optical and numerical images. Then, the combustion and flow regimes are vividly demonstrated. Subsequently, the temporal evolution of dynamic behaviors, including mode transition and oscillating flame, is characterized to reveal the potential control mechanism. Finally, some significant conclusions are drawn."

A series of experimental studies using this facility can be found in literature [\\[5](#page-11-0),[45](#page-11-0)[,46](#page-12-0)], in which the data are collected using various measurement techniques such as schlieren, chemiluminescence photography, OH-PLIF, and differential interferometry."

Further topologically identical coarser (1.0 million) and finer (7.0 million) grids are generated for case 1 in order to do a grid independence study. The pressure distributions on the upper wall are shown to be nearly identical apart from the leading edge of the expansion section, where the moderate and finer grids predict lower values than the coarser one, which is consistent with what was seen in Cao's investigations [\\[11](#page-11-0)]. This might be due to local refinement capturing multiscale turbulence at the expansion fan. The simulations for both cases are conducted on the moderate grid (5.0 million) in order to make a compromise between the fidelity and efficiency. As can be seen in Fig. [3,](#page-4-0) the pressure distribution on the upper wall matches the experimental results well for both cases except the separation point pressure in the isolator for case 2, which is slightly overpredicted. The absence of good near-wall resolution might be the most important factor among the other factors explaining the overprediction. In addition, a sharp pressure drop can also be observed owing to the rapid expansion of a high-pressure jet near the inlet, but it is not captured by the discrete pressure measurements. Anyway, these discrepancies are all acceptable."

Furthermore, the corner recirculation zone plays a vital role in maintaining continuous ignition of the fuel jet. Although there is no primary recirculation zone within the cavity, the hot products that flow downstream have positive effects on the jet-wake flame. This is because pure jet-wake stabilized combustion is not attainable under low inflow stagnation temperatures [\\[9\\]](#page-11-0). Additionally, the shear layer and shock train exhibit violent oscillations due to large-scale vortex shedding. As a result, the flow field is complex and intrinsically unstable."

It is convincing that the most energetic POM (mode #1) is in close proximity to the dominant flame mode. Similar consistency is also observed in the lower-frequency modes. The spatial structures of the first three POMs are depicted in Fig. 15(b). In mode #1, the rapid exchange of momentum generates a pair of counter-rotating vortices when the high-speed jet penetrates the low-speed separated flow. The upstream vortex, which directly interacts with the fuel jet, explains the periodic variation in the penetration depth of the jet, while the downstream vortex determines the oscillation characteristics of the flame. In mode #2, a similar but larger counter-rotating vortex pair is generated, and the upstream vortex extends to the tail of the isolator. Mode #3 embodies the coherent structures that are related to the largest-amplitude flame oscillation. A single large vortex can be observed at the cavity exit, which occupies the entire height and entrains the flame into the cavity floor, consistent with the previous analyses. The vortex is generated by the sudden contraction of the channel when entering the expansion section. Therefore, it is expected that low-frequency oscillations of this kind can be suppressed by optimizing the dimensional parameters of the combustor."

The first one was represented by a swing flame with large-amplitude flame flashback caused by jet/shear-layer interaction. The second one was characterized by the high-frequency flame flashback induced by unsteady heatrelease. In the last one, the intensive heat-release promoted the establishment of a large-area separation zone, which led to the oscillation of combustion mode followed by the complete transition. In addition, the unsteady jet-wake ram combustion presented three oscillation modes. The presence of a counter-rotating vortex pair in the front part of the cavity (10476 Hz and 2381 Hz), and a single large-scale vortex at the cavity exit (476 Hz) sustained the large-amplitude shear-layer oscillations, which gave rise to the periodic disintegration of the fuel jet, as well as intermittent flameout further downstream."

TemporalFlowViz combines ViT embeddings, interactive trajectory construction, density-based clustering, and expertaugmented semantic summarization to support interpretable analysis of high-dimensional, time-sequenced combustion data. By allowing experts to annotate representative cluster centroids, which then condition a vision–language model for generating frame- and case-level descriptions, we establish a reusable semantic layer that transforms complex flow field patterns into interpretable textual narratives. This multimodal annotation pipeline enables automated reporting, similarity-driven retrieval, and collaborative analysis with minimal manual overhead. We demonstrated the utility of TemporalFlowViz through two expert-driven case studies focusing on pressure and OH field dynamics. These studies revealed the system's ability to distinguish combustion modes, uncover evolution patterns, and support scalable interpretation across parameterized simulations. Expert feedback confirmed that the system accelerates hypothesis validation, reduces cognitive load, and facilitates knowledge sharing across teams. In summary, TemporalFlowViz represents a step toward deeply integrated, expert-informed visual analytics for scientific simulations—fusing deep learning, trajectorybased reasoning, and semantic interpretability into a unified framework for understanding combustion dynamics at scale."

In the simulation of a cavityfloor direct-injection scramjet, Sitaraman et al.

[[28](#page-11-0)] conducted an experimental investigation on the flame behavior during scram to ram transition. They have concluded that the flame fluctuated in the isolator due to the coupling between fluid dynamics and combustion and that the reversely propagating deflagration flame occurred when the thermal choke was established. In a DMSJ engine with fin-guided injection upstream of the cavity, the scram-to-ram transition was experimentally studied by Aguilera et al. [\\[29](#page-11-0)]. The findings indicated that the transition process could be characterized by a series of flame oscillations driven by hopping cycles, which included transient thermal choking, flame flashback, cavity flame-holding, and detachment. The combustion flow field in a scramjet is inherently unstable and is characterized by the presence of temporal oscillations that have an impact on the fluid flow, mixing, and heat release. Although separation-driven supersonic combustion instability has not yet received enough attention [[30](#page-11-0)], research on backpressure-induced unstable flames is very important in order to understand their physical mechanisms and impose appropriate controls."

Consequently, the flame is highly susceptible to the combined effects of large-scale separation vortexes and fuel jet. Even when subjected to severe shear-layer oscillations, the flame is prone to intermittent flameout [\\[9\\]](#page-11-0). In order to examine the impact of coherent structures on flame behavior under the combined action of unstable inflow and vertical jet. This work utilizes the height variation of the *T* = 1800 K isoline at *x* = 220 mm in the center slice to characterize the flame oscillation level, as shown in Fig. 13. The temporal evolution of the flame covers a maximum oscillation period (mode #3) from *t* = 3*.*05 ms to *t* = 4*.*45 ms, during which the flame exhibits the largest amplitude and almost touches the cavity floor. In mode #2 (*t* = 3*.*45 ∼ 3*.*90 ms), the flame position extends beyond the cavity step but does not reach the floor. Fig. [2](#page-4-0) provides a close-up view of mode #2, with the yellow line denoting the dominant mode (mode #1) and a frequency of approximately 8796 Hz. It is evident that the dominant mode corresponds to the self-sustained shear-layer oscillation induced by vortex shedding."

However, the large scale and high dimensionality of simulation-generated temporal flow field data present significant challenges for visual interpretation, feature differentiation, and cross-case comparison. In this paper, we present TemporalFlowViz, a parameter-aware visual analytics workflow and system designed to support expert-driven clustering, visualization, and interpretation of temporal flow fields from scramjet combustion simulations. Our approach leverages hundreds of simulated combustion cases with varying initial conditions, each producing time-sequenced flow field images. We use pretrained Vision Transformers to extract high-dimensional embeddings from these frames, apply dimensionality reduction and density-based clustering to uncover latent combustion modes, and construct temporal trajectories in the embedding space to track the evolution of each simulation over time. To bridge the gap between latent representations and expert reasoning, domain specialists annotate representative cluster centroids with descriptive labels. These annotations are used as contextual prompts for a vision–language model, which generates natural-language summaries for individual frames and full simulation cases. The system also supports parameter-based filtering, similarity-based case retrieval, and coordinated multi-view exploration to facilitate in-depth analysis. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TemporalFlowViz through two expert-informed case studies and expert feedback, showing TemporalFlowViz enhances hypothesis generation, supports interpretable pattern discovery, and enhances knowledge discovery in large-scale scramjet combustion analysis."

TemporalFlowViz combines ViT embeddings, interactive trajectory construction, density-based clustering, and expertaugmented semantic summarization to support interpretable analysis of high-dimensional, time-sequenced combustion data. By allowing experts to annotate representative cluster centroids, which then condition a vision–language model for generating frame- and case-level descriptions, we establish a reusable semantic layer that transforms complex flow field patterns into interpretable textual narratives. This multimodal annotation pipeline enables automated reporting, similarity-driven retrieval, and collaborative analysis with minimal manual overhead. We demonstrated the utility of TemporalFlowViz through two expert-driven case studies focusing on pressure and OH field dynamics. These studies revealed the system's ability to distinguish combustion modes, uncover evolution patterns, and support scalable interpretation across parameterized simulations. Expert feedback confirmed that the system accelerates hypothesis validation, reduces cognitive load, and facilitates knowledge sharing across teams. In summary, TemporalFlowViz represents a step toward deeply integrated, expert-informed visual analytics for scientific simulations—fusing deep learning, trajectorybased reasoning, and semantic interpretability into a unified framework for understanding combustion dynamics at scale."

Thus, unsteady supersonic combustion is an urgent problem that needs to be solved for real scramjet engine applications. This work helps to advance the knowledge of dual-mode scramjet combustion operating with different equivalence ratios by conducting quantitative analyses that characterize flame dynamics under flow separation. A hydrogenfueled direct-injection scheme was computed using *blastFoam* code via large-eddy simulation of a scramjet test rig at a stagnation temperature of 950 K and a pressure of 0.82 MPa. The computational results were in good agreement with the experimental data, and two typical flame structures (cavity shear-layer and cavity assisted jet-wake stabilized flame) corresponding to the scram/ram operating modes were reproduced. The local flame structure and flow regime were investigated using a modified flame index and filter functions. A particular focus was set on the continuous flame flashback during mode transition, which could be divided into three stages involving jet/shear-layer interaction, unsteady heat release, and the establishment of a large-area separation zone, with the decay of the cavity recirculation zone. Additionally, the unsteady jet-wake ram combustion presented three oscillation modes, giving rise to intermittent flameout of varying levels. The coherent-structures motion caused by the combined effects of low-speed separated flow and the fuel-jet was the main cause for this kind of unsteady combustion."

A hydrogenfueled direct-injection scheme was computed using *blastFoam* code via large-eddy simulation of a scramjet test rig at a stagnation temperature of 950 K and a pressure of 0.82 MPa. The computational results were in good agreement with the experimental data, and two typical flame structures (cavity shear-layer and cavity assisted jet-wake stabilized flame) corresponding to the scram/ram operating modes were reproduced. The local flame structure and flow regime were investigated using a modified flame index and filter functions. A particular focus was set on the continuous flame flashback during mode transition, which could be divided into three stages involving jet/shear-layer interaction, unsteady heat release, and the establishment of a large-area separation zone, with the decay of the cavity recirculation zone. Additionally, the unsteady jet-wake ram combustion presented three oscillation modes, giving rise to intermittent flameout of varying levels. The coherent-structures motion caused by the combined effects of low-speed separated flow and the fuel-jet was the main cause for this kind of unsteady combustion."

They have concluded that the flame fluctuated in the isolator due to the coupling between fluid dynamics and combustion and that the reversely propagating deflagration flame occurred when the thermal choke was established. In a DMSJ engine with fin-guided injection upstream of the cavity, the scram-to-ram transition was experimentally studied by Aguilera et al. [\\[29](#page-11-0)]. The findings indicated that the transition process could be characterized by a series of flame oscillations driven by hopping cycles, which included transient thermal choking, flame flashback, cavity flame-holding, and detachment. The combustion flow field in a scramjet is inherently unstable and is characterized by the presence of temporal oscillations that have an impact on the fluid flow, mixing, and heat release. Although separation-driven supersonic combustion instability has not yet received enough attention [[30](#page-11-0)], research on backpressure-induced unstable flames is very important in order to understand their physical mechanisms and impose appropriate controls."

The combustion instabilities associated with mode transition are typically more intense and severe due to the tendency toward cavity flame blowout [[21\\]](#page-11-0). Yang et al. [[27](#page-11-0)] provided a mechanical model of the DMSJ engine to analyze the mode transition mechanisms. It was found that the mode transition was a nonlinear and unstable process with significant Mach number fluctuations that had an adverse effect on the scramjet's stability. Kato et al. [[28](#page-11-0)] conducted an experimental investigation on the flame behavior during scram to ram transition. They have concluded that the flame fluctuated in the isolator due to the coupling between fluid dynamics and combustion and that the reversely propagating deflagration flame occurred when the thermal choke was established. In a DMSJ engine with fin-guided injection upstream of the cavity, the scram-to-ram transition was experimentally studied by Aguilera et al. [\\[29](#page-11-0)]. The findings indicated that the transition process could be characterized by a series of flame oscillations driven by hopping cycles, which included transient thermal choking, flame flashback, cavity flame-holding, and detachment. The combustion flow field in a scramjet is inherently unstable and is characterized by the presence of temporal oscillations that have an impact on the fluid flow, mixing, and heat release. Although separation-driven supersonic combustion instability has not yet received enough attention [[30](#page-11-0)], research on backpressure-induced unstable flames is very important in order to understand their physical mechanisms and impose appropriate controls."

This might be due to local refinement capturing multiscale turbulence at the expansion fan. The simulations for both cases are conducted on the moderate grid (5.0 million) in order to make a compromise between the fidelity and efficiency. As can be seen in Fig. [3,](#page-4-0) the pressure distribution on the upper wall matches the experimental results well for both cases except the separation point pressure in the isolator for case 2, which is slightly overpredicted. The absence of good near-wall resolution might be the most important factor among the other factors explaining the overprediction. In addition, a sharp pressure drop can also be observed owing to the rapid expansion of a high-pressure jet near the inlet, but it is not captured by the discrete pressure measurements.

The fuel-jet core in case 1 has a branch due to the strong entrainment, and a significant amount of hydrogen collects in the corner to maintain the upstream flame's fuel supply. The downstream flame receives radicals and a hot environment from the cavity recirculation zone, which is located at the rear of the shear-layer. This process is known as cavity shear-layer stabilized combustion. The cold jet penetrates the shear-layer and causes local extinction, in contrast to the outcomes of injection upstream of the cavity [\\[9\\]](#page-11-0). But the whole flame remains stable, since it is mainly held by the vortex interactions with the cavity rather than the streamwise transportation. In case 2, a significant corner recirculation zone is also generated. Nevertheless, its jet momentum is higher and the recirculation velocity is lower than in case 1. In order to prevent hydrogen from being heavily entrained into the corner, hot products collect instead, acting as an ignitor. It is important to note that the cavity lacks a primary recirculation zone, which may be the result of interactions between the fuel jet and low-speed separated flow in a configuration with a large length to depth ratio (L/D = 11). Similarly, it can be inferred as cavity assisted jet-wake stabilized combustion, though it is susceptible to the flow oscillation."

Additionally, the pressure response recorded in the tail of the isolator (P2) depicts the upstream propagation of backpressure. Based on the severity of the flame flashback, the entire process can be categorized into three stages. In stage #1, the pressure in the cavity rapidly increases with an increase in injection pressure. Although a weak backpressure is observed in the isolator, a severe flashback phenomenon is observed, which is also evident in the early stage of Fig. 10. This phenomenon is mainly associated with the sudden disturbance of the jet to shear-layer under stronger penetrability. In stage #2, the pressure tendency in the cavity remains relatively stable, and the combustor is in a state of energy accumulation by heat-release. The propagation abilities of backpressure and flame flashback are both weak, while the frequency is notably higher due to unsteady heat-release. In the critical stage of mode transition (stage #3), long-term and large-amplitude pressure responses can be detected in the isolator, indicating the establishment of a large-area separation zone. Furthermore, multiple reciprocating oscillations of the separated flow and continuous severe flame flashback phenomenon can be observed. The obvious large-amplitude oscillation mode with a rapid-growing trend is monitored in the cavity, which is caused by the continuous pressurization and depressurization cycles. It can be inferred that the transient thermal choking occurs in this stage, and the intensive heat-release plays a significant role in promoting the mode transition in this stage."

In order to examine the impact of coherent structures on flame behavior under the combined action of unstable inflow and vertical jet. This work utilizes the height variation of the *T* = 1800 K isoline at *x* = 220 mm in the center slice to characterize the flame oscillation level, as shown in Fig. 13. The temporal evolution of the flame covers a maximum oscillation period (mode #3) from *t* = 3*.*05 ms to *t* = 4*.*45 ms, during which the flame exhibits the largest amplitude and almost touches the cavity floor. In mode #2 (*t* = 3*.*45 ∼ 3*.*90 ms), the flame position extends beyond the cavity step but does not reach the floor. Fig. [2](#page-4-0) provides a close-up view of mode #2, with the yellow line denoting the dominant mode (mode #1) and a frequency of approximately 8796 Hz. It is evident that the dominant mode corresponds to the self-sustained shear-layer oscillation induced by vortex shedding."

It is convincing that the most energetic POM (mode #1) is in close proximity to the dominant flame mode. Similar consistency is also observed in the lower-frequency modes. The spatial structures of the first three POMs are depicted in Fig. 15(b). In mode #1, the rapid exchange of momentum generates a pair of counter-rotating vortices when the high-speed jet penetrates the low-speed separated flow. The upstream vortex, which directly interacts with the fuel jet, explains the periodic variation in the penetration depth of the jet, while the downstream vortex determines the oscillation characteristics of the flame. In mode #2, a similar but larger counter-rotating vortex pair is generated, and the upstream vortex extends to the tail of the isolator. Mode #3 embodies the coherent structures that are related to the largest-amplitude flame oscillation. A single large vortex can be observed at the cavity exit, which occupies the entire height and entrains the flame into the cavity floor, consistent with the previous analyses. The vortex is generated by the sudden contraction of the channel when entering the expansion section. Therefore, it is expected that low-frequency oscillations of this kind can be suppressed by optimizing the dimensional parameters of the combustor."

In contrast, Gemma-3 offers lightweight 4-bit and 8-bit quantizations and efficient image-to-text generation speed. It successfully processes multiple images in a single pass without out-ofmemory failures, making it more suitable for our batch-oriented visual analytics workflow.

According to InternViT-based clustering results, trajectories corresponding to stable scramjet combustion always remained within small round clusters, such as circles (a)–(d) in [Fig. 6.](#page-7-0) In contrast, ramjet cases typically originated from such clusters and terminated in larger clusters such as (e), which aggregated stable ramjet frames."

Based on domain knowledge, we assigned higher weights to the upper region of the engine, where the OH field exhibited stronger variation and contains more informative flame structures. Less active regions, such as the left portion of the domain, received smaller weights. These weighted OH field images were then encoded into highdimensional embeddings using a pretrained BLIP-2 Vision Transformer (ViT) model, capturing localized combustion characteristics across time."

TemporalFlowViz combines ViT embeddings, interactive trajectory construction, density-based clustering, and expertaugmented semantic summarization to support interpretable analysis of high-dimensional, time-sequenced combustion data. By allowing experts to annotate representative cluster centroids, which then condition a vision–language model for generating frame- and case-level descriptions, we establish a reusable semantic layer that transforms complex flow field patterns into interpretable textual narratives. This multimodal annotation pipeline enables automated reporting, similarity-driven retrieval, and collaborative analysis with minimal manual overhead. We demonstrated the utility of TemporalFlowViz through two expert-driven case studies focusing on pressure and OH field dynamics. These studies revealed the system's ability to distinguish combustion modes, uncover evolution patterns, and support scalable interpretation across parameterized simulations. Expert feedback confirmed that the system accelerates hypothesis validation, reduces cognitive load, and facilitates knowledge sharing across teams. In summary, TemporalFlowViz represents a step toward deeply integrated, expert-informed visual analytics for scientific simulations—fusing deep learning, trajectorybased reasoning, and semantic interpretability into a unified framework for understanding combustion dynamics at scale."

The computational results were in good agreement with the experimental data, and two typical flame structures (cavity shear-layer and cavity assisted jet-wake stabilized flame) corresponding to the scram/ram operating modes were reproduced. The local flame structure and flow regime were investigated using a modified flame index and filter functions. A particular focus was set on the continuous flame flashback during mode transition, which could be divided into three stages involving jet/shear-layer interaction, unsteady heat release, and the establishment of a large-area separation zone, with the decay of the cavity recirculation zone. Additionally, the unsteady jet-wake ram combustion presented three oscillation modes, giving rise to intermittent flameout of varying levels. The coherent-structures motion caused by the combined effects of low-speed separated flow and the fuel-jet was the main cause for this kind of unsteady combustion."

      "paragraph_info": "The combustion process in the scramjet engines generally takes place in unsteady conditions. The unsteadiness of the flame can be present locally or globally in supersonic combustion, for instance, reactant mixing, ignition, flame stabilization, and blow-off. Thus, unsteady supersonic combustion is an urgent problem that needs to be solved for real scramjet engine applications. This work helps to advance the knowledge of dual-mode scramjet combustion operating with different equivalence ratios by conducting quantitative analyses that characterize flame dynamics under flow separation. A hydrogenfueled direct-injection scheme was computed using *blastFoam* code via large-eddy simulation of a scramjet test rig at a stagnation temperature of 950 K and a pressure of 0.82 MPa. The computational results were in good agreement with the experimental data, and two typical flame structures (cavity shear-layer and cavity assisted jet-wake stabilized flame) corresponding to the scram/ram operating modes were reproduced. The local flame structure and flow regime were investigated using a modified flame index and filter functions. A particular focus was set on the continuous flame flashback during mode transition, which could be divided into three stages involving jet/shear-layer interaction, unsteady heat release, and the establishment of a large-area separation zone, with the decay of the cavity recirculation zone.

Wang et al. [\\[19](#page-11-0)] have numerically found two flowrelated combustion oscillation mechanisms in the scramjet with hydrogen injected upstream of the cavity. One was the intermittent auto-ignition of mixture packets linked to the fuel jet, and the other was the unsteady flame propagation affected by the jet/cavity shear-layer interaction. In the simulation of a cavityfloor direct-injection scramjet, Sitaraman et al. [\\[22](#page-11-0)] also noticed low-frequency heat release and pressure oscillations and attributed them to the periodic fluctuation of jet penetration brought on by the interaction with the shear layer. In a DMSJ engine, intensive heat release will alter the inflow conditions through the large-scale flow separation induced by upstream-propagating backpressure, which in turn modulates the flame stability downstream [\\[23\\]](#page-11-0). The possible interaction with fuel jets complicates the instability process even more. According to a series of well-known studies [\\[5,9,24,25\\]](#page-11-0), once the heat release reached a high enough level, there was a noticeable unsteadiness. Wang et al. [\\[26\\]](#page-11-0) experimentally studied the oscillation features of shock-train structures in an isolator with a choked throat, and found that the shock-train oscillation could propagate further downstream along the thicker boundary layer, resulting in drastic coherence and pressure fluctuations in downstream separated flow. Fotia et al. [\\[18](#page-11-0)] carried out an experimental study on the hydrogen-fueled DMSJ engine and observed some low-frequency periodic oscillations of the flame position under the separated flow, which could be correlated with the upstream unsteady pre-combustion shock-train."

Further topologically identical coarser (1.0 million) and finer (7.0 million) grids are generated for case 1 in order to do a grid independence study. The pressure distributions on the upper wall are shown to be nearly identical apart from the leading edge of the expansion section, where the moderate and finer grids predict lower values than the coarser one, which is consistent with what was seen in Cao's investigations [\\[11](#page-11-0)]. This might be due to local refinement capturing multiscale turbulence at the expansion fan. The simulations for both cases are conducted on the moderate grid (5.0 million) in order to make a compromise between the fidelity and efficiency. As can be seen in Fig. [3,](#page-4-0) the pressure distribution on the upper wall matches the experimental results well for both cases except the separation point pressure in the isolator for case 2, which is slightly overpredicted. The absence of good near-wall resolution might be the most important factor among the other factors explaining the overprediction. In addition, a sharp pressure drop can also be observed owing to the rapid expansion of a high-pressure jet near the inlet, but it is not captured by the discrete pressure measurements. Anyway, these discrepancies are all acceptable."

The 3-D vortex structures in the cavity of case 2 are found to be larger than those of case 1, primarily initiated by the shock/boundary-layer interaction in the isolator and intensified by thermal expansion in the cavity. Moreover, hairpin-like vortexes induced by the shock/boundary-layer interaction are observed on the lower wall. Both flames are confined in the vortexes that enhance fluid mixing, causing the flame in case 1 to be inside the cavity or close to the upper wall of the expansion section, while that in case 2 oscillates violently and the intermittent blowoff is observed downstream. Fig. [8](#page-7-0)(c) shows the time-averaged Mach number contours, embodying two typical features of a dual-mode scramjet. In scram mode, the flow in almost the entire combustor, except for the cavity, is supersonic. In ram mode, the subsonic region extends to the isolator and expansion section, and the supersonic channel is similar to the Laval nozzle, with a thermal throat at the cavity rear-part (*x* = 250 mm)."

      "paragraph_info": "Fig. [12](#page-9-0) presents the temporal evolutions of pressure signals and flame flashback distance. Notably, the pressure waveform measured in the cavity (P1) exhibits a high-frequency oscillation, which can be attributed to the acoustic motion in the subsonic region [\\[22\\]](#page-11-0). Additionally, the pressure response recorded in the tail of the isolator (P2) depicts the upstream propagation of backpressure. Based on the severity of the flame flashback, the entire process can be categorized into three stages. In stage #1, the pressure in the cavity rapidly increases with an increase in injection pressure. Although a weak backpressure is observed in the isolator, a severe flashback phenomenon is observed, which is also evident in the early stage of Fig. 10. This phenomenon is mainly associated with the sudden disturbance of the jet to shear-layer under stronger penetrability. In stage #2, the pressure tendency in the cavity remains relatively stable, and the combustor is in a state of energy accumulation by heat-release. The propagation abilities of backpressure and flame flashback are both weak, while the frequency is notably higher due to unsteady heat-release. In the critical stage of mode transition (stage #3), long-term and large-amplitude pressure responses can be detected in the isolator, indicating the establishment of a large-area separation zone. Furthermore, multiple reciprocating oscillations of the separated flow and continuous severe flame flashback phenomenon can be observed. The obvious large-amplitude oscillation mode with a rapid-growing trend is monitored in the cavity, which is caused by the continuous pressurization and depressurization cycles. It can be inferred that the transient thermal choking occurs in this stage, and the intensive heat-release plays a significant role in promoting the mode transition in this stage."

However, the large scale and high dimensionality of simulation-generated temporal flow field data present significant challenges for visual interpretation, feature differentiation, and cross-case comparison. In this paper, we present TemporalFlowViz, a parameter-aware visual analytics workflow and system designed to support expert-driven clustering, visualization, and interpretation of temporal flow fields from scramjet combustion simulations. Our approach leverages hundreds of simulated combustion cases with varying initial conditions, each producing time-sequenced flow field images. We use pretrained Vision Transformers to extract high-dimensional embeddings from these frames, apply dimensionality reduction and density-based clustering to uncover latent combustion modes, and construct temporal trajectories in the embedding space to track the evolution of each simulation over time. To bridge the gap between latent representations and expert reasoning, domain specialists annotate representative cluster centroids with descriptive labels. These annotations are used as contextual prompts for a vision–language model, which generates natural-language summaries for individual frames and full simulation cases. The system also supports parameter-based filtering, similarity-based case retrieval, and coordinated multi-view exploration to facilitate in-depth analysis. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TemporalFlowViz through two expert-informed case studies and expert feedback, showing TemporalFlowViz enhances hypothesis generation, supports interpretable pattern discovery, and enhances knowledge discovery in large-scale scramjet combustion analysis."

To bridge the gap between latent representations and expert reasoning, domain specialists annotate representative cluster centroids with descriptive labels. These annotations are used as contextual prompts for a vision–language model, which generates natural-language summaries for individual frames and full simulation cases. The system also supports parameter-based filtering, similarity-based case retrieval, and coordinated multi-view exploration to facilitate in-depth analysis. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TemporalFlowViz through two expert-informed case studies and expert feedback, showing TemporalFlowViz enhances hypothesis generation, supports interpretable pattern discovery, and enhances knowledge discovery in large-scale scramjet combustion analysis."

Density-based methods attempt to cluster data points by appropriate density functions, including density-based spatial clustering with noise [\\[32\\]](#page-9-22). Compared with the previous methods, connectivity-based methods cluster data points into a cluster if they are highly connected. A commonly used method is spectral clustering [\\[34\\]](#page-9-23). The above ideas form the basis of many methods, such as ensemble clustering [\\[14\\]](#page-9-24), clustering based on non-negative matrix factorization [\\[3\\]](#page-9-25), etc."

Notably, the pressure waveform measured in the cavity (P1) exhibits a high-frequency oscillation, which can be attributed to the acoustic motion in the subsonic region [\\[22\\]](#page-11-0). Additionally, the pressure response recorded in the tail of the isolator (P2) depicts the upstream propagation of backpressure. Based on the severity of the flame flashback, the entire process can be categorized into three stages. In stage #1, the pressure in the cavity rapidly increases with an increase in injection pressure. Although a weak backpressure is observed in the isolator, a severe flashback phenomenon is observed, which is also evident in the early stage of Fig. 10. This phenomenon is mainly associated with the sudden disturbance of the jet to shear-layer under stronger penetrability.

However, the large scale and high dimensionality of simulation-generated temporal flow field data present significant challenges for visual interpretation, feature differentiation, and cross-case comparison. In this paper, we present TemporalFlowViz, a parameter-aware visual analytics workflow and system designed to support expert-driven clustering, visualization, and interpretation of temporal flow fields from scramjet combustion simulations. Our approach leverages hundreds of simulated combustion cases with varying initial conditions, each producing time-sequenced flow field images. We use pretrained Vision Transformers to extract high-dimensional embeddings from these frames, apply dimensionality reduction and density-based clustering to uncover latent combustion modes, and construct temporal trajectories in the embedding space to track the evolution of each simulation over time. To bridge the gap between latent representations and expert reasoning, domain specialists annotate representative cluster centroids with descriptive labels. These annotations are used as contextual prompts for a vision–language model, which generates natural-language summaries for individual frames and full simulation cases. The system also supports parameter-based filtering, similarity-based case retrieval, and coordinated multi-view exploration to facilitate in-depth analysis. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TemporalFlowViz through two expert-informed case studies and expert feedback, showing TemporalFlowViz enhances hypothesis generation, supports interpretable pattern discovery, and enhances knowledge discovery in large-scale scramjet combustion analysis."
