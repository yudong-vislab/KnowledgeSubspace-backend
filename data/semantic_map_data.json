In this paper, we present TemporalFlowViz, a parameter-aware visual analytics workflow and system designed to support expert-driven clustering, visualization, and interpretation of temporal flow fields from scramjet combustion simulations. Our approach leverages hundreds of simulated combustion cases with varying initial conditions, each producing time-sequenced flow field images. We use pretrained Vision Transformers to extract high-dimensional embeddings from these frames, apply dimensionality reduction and density-based clustering to uncover latent combustion modes, and construct temporal trajectories in the embedding space to track the evolution of each simulation over time. To bridge the gap between latent representations and expert reasoning, domain specialists annotate representative cluster centroids with descriptive labels. These annotations are used as contextual prompts for a vision–language model, which generates natural-language summaries for individual frames and full simulation cases. The system also supports parameter-based filtering, similarity-based case retrieval, and coordinated multi-view exploration to facilitate in-depth analysis. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TemporalFlowViz through two expert-informed case studies and expert feedback, showing TemporalFlowViz enhances hypothesis generation, supports interpretable pattern discovery, and enhances knowledge discovery in large-scale scramjet combustion analysis.",

The fuel-jet core in case 1 has a branch due to the strong entrainment, and a significant amount of hydrogen collects in the corner to maintain the upstream flame's fuel supply. The downstream flame receives radicals and a hot environment from the cavity recirculation zone, which is located at the rear of the shear-layer. This process is known as cavity shear-layer stabilized combustion. The cold jet penetrates the shear-layer and causes local extinction, in contrast to the outcomes of injection upstream of the cavity [\\[9\\]](#page-11-0). But the whole flame remains stable, since it is mainly held by the vortex interactions with the cavity rather than the streamwise transportation. In case 2, a significant corner recirculation zone is also generated. Nevertheless, its jet momentum is higher and the recirculation velocity is lower than in case 1. In order to prevent hydrogen from being heavily entrained into the corner, hot products collect instead, acting as an ignitor. It is important to note that the cavity lacks a primary recirculation zone, which may be the result of interactions between the fuel jet and low-speed separated flow in a configuration with a large length to depth ratio (L/D = 11). Similarly, it can be inferred as cavity assisted jet-wake stabilized combustion, though it is susceptible to the flow oscillation.",

In ram mode (case 2), the ratios of supersonic and subsonic downstream flow are almost symmetrical. One may observe that their ratios are equal at *x* = 175 mm, with each accounting for 50%. After that, the supersonic downstream flow ratio experiences a brief rise before declining to its minimum value (43%) at the thermal throat. Furthermore, there exist two peaks of subsonic upstream flow ratio within the engine, which occur at *x* = 75 mm in the isolator and at *x* = 160 mm in the cavity corner.

However, the large scale and high dimensionality of simulation-generated temporal flow field data present significant challenges for visual interpretation, feature differentiation, and cross-case comparison. In this paper, we present TemporalFlowViz, a parameter-aware visual analytics workflow and system designed to support expert-driven clustering, visualization, and interpretation of temporal flow fields from scramjet combustion simulations. Our approach leverages hundreds of simulated combustion cases with varying initial conditions, each producing time-sequenced flow field images. We use pretrained Vision Transformers to extract high-dimensional embeddings from these frames, apply dimensionality reduction and density-based clustering to uncover latent combustion modes, and construct temporal trajectories in the embedding space to track the evolution of each simulation over time. To bridge the gap between latent representations and expert reasoning, domain specialists annotate representative cluster centroids with descriptive labels. These annotations are used as contextual prompts for a vision–language model, which generates natural-language summaries for individual frames and full simulation cases. The system also supports parameter-based filtering, similarity-based case retrieval, and coordinated multi-view exploration to facilitate in-depth analysis. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TemporalFlowViz through two expert-informed case studies and expert feedback, showing TemporalFlowViz enhances hypothesis generation, supports interpretable pattern discovery, and enhances knowledge discovery in large-scale scramjet combustion analysis.",

Li et al. [\\[17\\]](#page-9-27) propose a novel approach for generating accurate and robust medical image reports by integrating knowledge-driven encoding, retrieval, and paraphrasing mechanisms. The KERP approach decomposes medical report generation into three main steps: encoding visual features into a structured <span id=\"page-2-0\"></span>abnormality graph, retrieving relevant text templates based on detected abnormalities, and paraphrasing these templates to generate the final report. The core of KERP is the Graph Transformer, a novel implementation unit that dynamically transforms high-level semantics between graph-structured data across multiple domains, such as knowledge graphs, images, and sequences. Wang et al. [\\[31\\]](#page-9-28) introduce a framework to integrate LLMs with medical-image CAD networks. The proposed approach uses LLMs to enhance the outputs of multiple CAD networks—including diagnosis, lesion segmentation, and report generation networks—by summarizing and reorganizing information into natural language text. The goal is to combine LLMs' medical domain knowledge and logical reasoning with the visual understanding capabilities of existing CAD models, creating a more user-friendly and interpretable system for patients compared to traditional CAD systems. R2GenGPT [\\[33\\]](#page-9-29) leverages the pre-trained knowledge of LLMs while overcoming their inability to process visual data directly. By aligning image features with the LLM's text embedding space, the model enables frozen LLMs to generate radiology reports that integrate both visual insights and clinical language, without costly full fine-tuning of the LLM. This approach balances performance and efficiency, making it suitable for real-world medical applications.",

A zoomedin view was shown in [Fig. 6\\(](#page-7-0)a1), while frame snapshots were shown in (af). In this case, the pressure surges consistently occured between the isolator and cavity, and remained stationary—indicative of stable scramjet operation. According to InternViT-based clustering results, trajectories corresponding to stable scramjet combustion always remained within small round clusters, such as circles (a)–(d) in [Fig. 6.](#page-7-0) In contrast, ramjet cases typically originated from such clusters and terminated in larger clusters such as (e), which aggregated stable ramjet frames.",

[\\[7](#page-11-0)], and it was reported that the airflow conditions and the jet to crossflow pressure ratio both had a large impact except the injection strategy. By varying the injection pressure, Yan et al. [\\[8\\]](#page-11-0) compared the transition processes from scram to ram and from ram to scram. The results revealed that the transition from ram to scram was more challenging than from scram to ram, and the shock waves were still in the isolator when the combustor entered scram mode. Also, a lot of effort has been put into studying the mechanisms that stabilize combustion [\\[5,9](#page-11-0)–[11\\]](#page-11-0). Three common stabilization modes may be distinguished [\\[9](#page-11-0)] based on where the flame anchors: cavity shear-layer stabilized combustion, cavity assisted jet-wake stabilized combustion, and combined cavity shear-layer/recirculation stabilized combustion. The correlation between operating and stabilization modes of the DMSJ combustor was further investigated by Yuan et al. [\\[10\\]](#page-11-0), who observed that the flame was stabilized in the cavity shear-layer at scram mode while in the jet-wake at ram mode.",

However, the large scale and high dimensionality of simulation-generated temporal flow field data present significant challenges for visual interpretation, feature differentiation, and cross-case comparison. In this paper, we present TemporalFlowViz, a parameter-aware visual analytics workflow and system designed to support expert-driven clustering, visualization, and interpretation of temporal flow fields from scramjet combustion simulations. Our approach leverages hundreds of simulated combustion cases with varying initial conditions, each producing time-sequenced flow field images. We use pretrained Vision Transformers to extract high-dimensional embeddings from these frames, apply dimensionality reduction and density-based clustering to uncover latent combustion modes, and construct temporal trajectories in the embedding space to track the evolution of each simulation over time. To bridge the gap between latent representations and expert reasoning, domain specialists annotate representative cluster centroids with descriptive labels. These annotations are used as contextual prompts for a vision–language model, which generates natural-language summaries for individual frames and full simulation cases. The system also supports parameter-based filtering, similarity-based case retrieval, and coordinated multi-view exploration to facilitate in-depth analysis. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TemporalFlowViz through two expert-informed case studies and expert feedback, showing TemporalFlowViz enhances hypothesis generation, supports interpretable pattern discovery, and enhances knowledge discovery in large-scale scramjet combustion analysis.",

By allowing experts to annotate representative cluster centroids, which then condition a vision–language model for generating frame- and case-level descriptions, we establish a reusable semantic layer that transforms complex flow field patterns into interpretable textual narratives. This multimodal annotation pipeline enables automated reporting, similarity-driven retrieval, and collaborative analysis with minimal manual overhead. We demonstrated the utility of TemporalFlowViz through two expert-driven case studies focusing on pressure and OH field dynamics. These studies revealed the system's ability to distinguish combustion modes, uncover evolution patterns, and support scalable interpretation across parameterized simulations. Expert feedback confirmed that the system accelerates hypothesis validation, reduces cognitive load, and facilitates knowledge sharing across teams. In summary, TemporalFlowViz represents a step toward deeply integrated, expert-informed visual analytics for scientific simulations—fusing deep learning, trajectorybased reasoning, and semantic interpretability into a unified framework for understanding combustion dynamics at scale.",

The unsteadiness of the flame can be present locally or globally in supersonic combustion, for instance, reactant mixing, ignition, flame stabilization, and blow-off. Thus, unsteady supersonic combustion is an urgent problem that needs to be solved for real scramjet engine applications. This work helps to advance the knowledge of dual-mode scramjet combustion operating with different equivalence ratios by conducting quantitative analyses that characterize flame dynamics under flow separation. A hydrogenfueled direct-injection scheme was computed using *blastFoam* code via large-eddy simulation of a scramjet test rig at a stagnation temperature of 950 K and a pressure of 0.82 MPa. The computational results were in good agreement with the experimental data, and two typical flame structures (cavity shear-layer and cavity assisted jet-wake stabilized flame) corresponding to the scram/ram operating modes were reproduced. The local flame structure and flow regime were investigated using a modified flame index and filter functions. A particular focus was set on the continuous flame flashback during mode transition, which could be divided into three stages involving jet/shear-layer interaction, unsteady heat release, and the establishment of a large-area separation zone, with the decay of the cavity recirculation zone. Additionally, the unsteady jet-wake ram combustion presented three oscillation modes, giving rise to intermittent flameout of varying levels. The coherent-structures motion caused by the combined effects of low-speed separated flow and the fuel-jet was the main cause for this kind of unsteady combustion.",

Further topologically identical coarser (1.0 million) and finer (7.0 million) grids are generated for case 1 in order to do a grid independence study. The pressure distributions on the upper wall are shown to be nearly identical apart from the leading edge of the expansion section, where the moderate and finer grids predict lower values than the coarser one, which is consistent with what was seen in Cao's investigations [\\[11](#page-11-0)]. This might be due to local refinement capturing multiscale turbulence at the expansion fan. The simulations for both cases are conducted on the moderate grid (5.0 million) in order to make a compromise between the fidelity and efficiency. As can be seen in Fig. [3,](#page-4-0) the pressure distribution on the upper wall matches the experimental results well for both cases except the separation point pressure in the isolator for case 2, which is slightly overpredicted. The absence of good near-wall resolution might be the most important factor among the other factors explaining the overprediction. In addition, a sharp pressure drop can also be observed owing to the rapid expansion of a high-pressure jet near the inlet, but it is not captured by the discrete pressure measurements. Anyway, these discrepancies are all acceptable.",

The downstream flame receives radicals and a hot environment from the cavity recirculation zone, which is located at the rear of the shear-layer. This process is known as cavity shear-layer stabilized combustion. The cold jet penetrates the shear-layer and causes local extinction, in contrast to the outcomes of injection upstream of the cavity [\\[9\\]](#page-11-0). But the whole flame remains stable, since it is mainly held by the vortex interactions with the cavity rather than the streamwise transportation. In case 2, a significant corner recirculation zone is also generated. Nevertheless, its jet momentum is higher and the recirculation velocity is lower than in case 1. In order to prevent hydrogen from being heavily entrained into the corner, hot products collect instead, acting as an ignitor. It is important to note that the cavity lacks a primary recirculation zone, which may be the result of interactions between the fuel jet and low-speed separated flow in a configuration with a large length to depth ratio (L/D = 11). Similarly, it can be inferred as cavity assisted jet-wake stabilized combustion, though it is susceptible to the flow oscillation.",

In this paper, we present TemporalFlowViz, a parameter-aware visual analytics workflow and system designed to support expert-driven clustering, visualization, and interpretation of temporal flow fields from scramjet combustion simulations. Our approach leverages hundreds of simulated combustion cases with varying initial conditions, each producing time-sequenced flow field images. We use pretrained Vision Transformers to extract high-dimensional embeddings from these frames, apply dimensionality reduction and density-based clustering to uncover latent combustion modes, and construct temporal trajectories in the embedding space to track the evolution of each simulation over time. To bridge the gap between latent representations and expert reasoning, domain specialists annotate representative cluster centroids with descriptive labels. These annotations are used as contextual prompts for a vision–language model, which generates natural-language summaries for individual frames and full simulation cases. The system also supports parameter-based filtering, similarity-based case retrieval, and coordinated multi-view exploration to facilitate in-depth analysis.

[[27](#page-11-0)] provided a mechanical model of the DMSJ engine to analyze the mode transition mechanisms. It was found that the mode transition was a nonlinear and unstable process with significant Mach number fluctuations that had an adverse effect on the scramjet's stability. Kato et al. [[28](#page-11-0)] conducted an experimental investigation on the flame behavior during scram to ram transition. They have concluded that the flame fluctuated in the isolator due to the coupling between fluid dynamics and combustion and that the reversely propagating deflagration flame occurred when the thermal choke was established. In a DMSJ engine with fin-guided injection upstream of the cavity, the scram-to-ram transition was experimentally studied by Aguilera et al. [\\[29](#page-11-0)]. The findings indicated that the transition process could be characterized by a series of flame oscillations driven by hopping cycles, which included transient thermal choking, flame flashback, cavity flame-holding, and detachment. The combustion flow field in a scramjet is inherently unstable and is characterized by the presence of temporal oscillations that have an impact on the fluid flow, mixing, and heat release. Although separation-driven supersonic combustion instability has not yet received enough attention [[30](#page-11-0)], research on backpressure-induced unstable flames is very important in order to understand their physical mechanisms and impose appropriate controls.",

Moreover, hairpin-like vortexes induced by the shock/boundary-layer interaction are observed on the lower wall. Both flames are confined in the vortexes that enhance fluid mixing, causing the flame in case 1 to be inside the cavity or close to the upper wall of the expansion section, while that in case 2 oscillates violently and the intermittent blowoff is observed downstream.

This work utilizes the height variation of the *T* = 1800 K isoline at *x* = 220 mm in the center slice to characterize the flame oscillation level, as shown in Fig. 13. The temporal evolution of the flame covers a maximum oscillation period (mode #3) from *t* = 3*.*05 ms to *t* = 4*.*45 ms, during which the flame exhibits the largest amplitude and almost touches the cavity floor.

In our experiment, the average convergence radius r (the average radius of the last *K* vertices (*K* = 5) of all the case trajectories) for PCA reduced embeddings of cropped flow fields ( $p_i(t)$ ), is reduced by  $35.24 \\pm 0.59\\%$ , compared to those of un-cropped flow fields. The convergence radius  $r_i$  of a trajectory of case *i* is defined as:  $r_i = \\frac{1}{K} \\sum_{t=t_i-K+1}^{t_i} ||p_i(t) - \\overline{p_i}||$ , where  $\\overline{p_i} = \\frac{1}{K} \\sum_{t=t_i-K+1}^{t_i} p_i(t)$ .

The resulting weighted images were encoded into high-dimensional embeddings using Blip2-opt-2.7b, InternViT-6B-v2.5, and AIMv2-1B, and processed through TemporalFlowViz. In all three kinds of ViT-based embeddings tested, the *Temporal Trajectory View* revealed a common structure: the temporal trajectories began in a dispersed region and gradually converged into a compact cluster. To better display the clustering results, we used InternViT to extract embeddings from frames.",

Based on domain knowledge, we assigned higher weights to the upper region of the engine, where the OH field exhibited stronger variation and contains more informative flame structures. Less active regions, such as the left portion of the domain, received smaller weights.

The corresponding OH field images for these cases were displayed in (f1)–(f3). Two distinct combustion modes were identified: the red cluster corresponds to the *shear layer combustion mode*, characterized by narrow, stratified flame structures along the fuel–air interface (see circled regions in (d)–(e)); the yellow cluster corresponded to the *jet-wake combustion mode*, where the flame formed a wide, curved tail extending from the fuel inlet (see circled regions in (a)–(b)). The clustering results demonstrated that the system could effectively separate and characterize combustion behaviors across different cases, even when OH field trajectories fluctuated at steady state.",

The 3-D vortex structures in the cavity of case 2 are found to be larger than those of case 1, primarily initiated by the shock/boundary-layer interaction in the isolator and intensified by thermal expansion in the cavity. Moreover, hairpin-like vortexes induced by the shock/boundary-layer interaction are observed on the lower wall. Both flames are confined in the vortexes that enhance fluid mixing, causing the flame in case 1 to be inside the cavity or close to the upper wall of the expansion section, while that in case 2 oscillates violently and the intermittent blowoff is observed downstream. Fig. [8](#page-7-0)(c) shows the time-averaged Mach number contours, embodying two typical features of a dual-mode scramjet. In scram mode, the flow in almost the entire combustor, except for the cavity, is supersonic. In ram mode, the subsonic region extends to the isolator and expansion section, and the supersonic channel is similar to the Laval nozzle, with a thermal throat at the cavity rear-part (*x* = 250 mm).",

Fig. [10](#page-8-0) presents the evolution of pressure and flame during the mode transition. In the left-hand figures, the white arrows indicate the direction of oblique shocks propagation. Following an increase in injection pressure, a high-pressure zone is generated below the jet due to the impediment effect with the forward propagating shocks. At snapshot \"C\", the shocks are blown back into the cavity owing to pressure relief and insufficient heatrelease, and a normal shock is observed in the cavity entrance, as <span id=\"page-7-0\"></span>*M.

The first three snapshots exhibit an evident recirculation, which corroborates the aforementioned cavity stabilized mode. When combined with the flame structure shown in Fig. [10,](#page-8-0) it is apparent that the jet-wake stabilized mode is established when the cavity recirculation zone completely disappears. Furthermore, when observing the pressure evolution, it is found that the boundary layer separates from the wall due to the adverse pressure gradient when shock waves propagate upstream, and return to attach to the wall when normal shock is generated at the separation point upon downstream propagation.",

      "number": "The combustion process in the scramjet engines generally takes place in unsteady conditions. The unsteadiness of the flame can be present locally or globally in supersonic combustion, for instance, reactant mixing, ignition, flame stabilization, and blow-off. Thus, unsteady supersonic combustion is an urgent problem that needs to be solved for real scramjet engine applications. This work helps to advance the knowledge of dual-mode scramjet combustion operating with different equivalence ratios by conducting quantitative analyses that characterize flame dynamics under flow separation. A hydrogenfueled direct-injection scheme was computed using *blastFoam* code via large-eddy simulation of a scramjet test rig at a stagnation temperature of 950 K and a pressure of 0.82 MPa. The computational results were in good agreement with the experimental data, and two typical flame structures (cavity shear-layer and cavity assisted jet-wake stabilized flame) corresponding to the scram/ram operating modes were reproduced. The local flame structure and flow regime were investigated using a modified flame index and filter functions. A particular focus was set on the continuous flame flashback during mode transition, which could be divided into three stages involving jet/shear-layer interaction, unsteady heat release, and the establishment of a large-area separation zone, with the decay of the cavity recirculation zone. Additionally, the unsteady jet-wake ram combustion presented three oscillation modes, giving rise to intermittent flameout of varying levels. The coherent-structures motion caused by the combined effects of low-speed separated flow and the fuel-jet was the main cause for this kind of unsteady combustion.",

In the current work, two cases with different global equivalence ratios (case 1: *ER* = 0*.*1 and case 2: *ER* = 0*.*3) are comparatively studied by changing the fuel jet's injection stagnation pressure (*p*<sup>0</sup> = 1*.*5 MPa and *p*<sup>0</sup> = 4*.*0 MPa), and then achieves a phenomenological scram-to-ram transition by directly switching the injection pressure from case 1 to case 2 to study the intermediate state.
