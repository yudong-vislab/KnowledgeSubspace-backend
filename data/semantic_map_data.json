Predicting air quality for any regions and at any time is a critical requirement of urban citizens. However, air pollution prediction for the whole city is a challenging problem. The reason is, there are many spatiotemporal factors affecting air pollution throughout the city. Collecting as many of them could help us to forecast air pollution better. In this research, we present many spatiotemporal datasets collected over Seoul city in Korea, which is currently much suffered by air pollution problem as well. These datasets include air pollution data, meteorological data, traffic volume, average driving speed, and air pollution indexes of external areas which are known to impact Seoul's air pollution. To the best of our knowledge, traffic volume and average driving speed data are two new datasets in air pollution research. In addition, recent research in air pollution has tried to build models to interpolate and predict air pollution in the city.

The traffic volume and average driving speed data are new datasets within all known air pollution related research. The traffic volume is collected hourly by vehicle detector devices at survey points in the road. They have both the inflow and outflow directions along the survey roads. The average driving speed data is also collected hourly and by the speed checkpoints. In fig. 2, we plot the locations of all traffic volume and vehicle speed survey points in the Seoul city's map. As we can observe, the traffic volume survey points and speed checkpoints are dense and cover quite well the area of Seoul city compared with the air pollution monitoring stations (in markers). Table I also represents some statistic analysis of these 2 datasets. In Table I, turns/hr is the number of vehicles running across a survey point in an hour.",

In fig. 8, we plot the output images of DAL, ConvLSTM, CNN Encoder-Decoder, and FC-LSTM model to see the distribution of air pollution interpolated values. Intuitively, FC-LSTM model shows the worst output with all the grid-cells except the existing monitoring stations have the same value. The reason is FC-LSTM networks do not learn the spatial features well, and thus do not give good interpolation output. For the remaining 3 models, ConvLSTM and DAL show pretty good air pollution interpolation compared with the CNN Encoder-Decoder model. To prove that ConvLSTM model produces better air pollution interpolated values over other baselines, we compare it with the actual air pollution values distribution. Here, we suggest testing the variance of the interpolated values.",

If the error is small then we can infer that other spatiotemporal data has a remarkable effect on air pollution interpolation. To measure the error, we alternately set the air pollution value of each existed input pixel to zero, keep other data of that pixel unchanged, running the trained model on this modified input data and calculate RMSE between the inferred value with the actual pixel value of the same position. The final error is the mean of all errors after doing this procedure with all existing air pollution values. We call this error spRMSE, which means the RMSE caused by spatiotemporal factors. The experiments results are shown in Table III. We can notice that ConvLSTM + Speed model has a better spRMSE than ConvLSTM in spite it has worse overall RMSE; which indicates the driving average speed affects air pollution in spatiotemporal form.

First, we described and resolved the citywide scale Air Pollution Interpolation and Prediction problem by considering a whole city to be one image. Second, we pointed out and collected several spatiotemporal datasets, which have effects on air pollution throughout the city. Lastly, we proposed a spatiotemporal Deep Learning based model for citywide air pollution interpolation and prediction. We proved that the proposed model does not only work better than CNN and LSTM themselves in spatial and temporal features analysis but also outperforms state-of-the-art relevant models. The leverage of using other spatiotemporal factors gives us a powerful model in interpolating and forecasting air pollution over the city.",

The demand for predicting future air quality is becoming increasingly more important to government's policy-making and people's decision making. In this paper, we predict the air quality of next 48 hours for each monitoring station, considering air quality data, meteorology data, and weather forecast data. Based on the domain knowledge about air pollution, we propose a deep neural network (DNN)-based approach (entitled DeepAir), which consists of a spatial transformation component and a deep distributed fusion network. Considering air pollutants' spatial correlations, the former component converts the spatial sparse air quality data into a consistent input to simulate the pollutant sources. The latter network adopts a neural distributed architecture to fuse heterogeneous urban data for simultaneously capturing the factors affecting air quality, e.g. meteorological conditions. We deployed DeepAir in our AirPollutionPrediction system, providing fine-grained air quality forecasts for 300+ Chinese cities every hour. The experimental results on the data from three-year nine Chinese-city demonstrate the advantages of DeepAir beyond 10 baseline methods.

Though rain has a higher ratio of air quality will be better, it is still difficult to model the interaction as the effect is not absolute. The reason behind it is that air quality is affected by multiple factors simultaneously shown in Figure 1, which the interactions are complex. As a result, it is hard to determine the weight of each factor due to the dynamic environment. Likewise, it is very difficult to capture the spatio-temporal characterizations of air pollution dispersion as air quality changes over location and fluctuate along time without an obvious periodic pattern.",

      "paragraph_info": "As shown in Figure 4, the framework of DeepAir consists of two parts: spatial transformation component and deep distributed fusion network. As air pollutants are dispersed in geographical space, the former component regards the readings recorded by air quality monitoring stations as second-hand pollutant sources. Considering air pollutants' spatial correlations, spatial transformation component uses the spatial partition, spatial aggregation, and spatial interpolation to convert the spatial sparse air quality data into a consistent input, named AQIs. Then, AQIs and other datasets, i.e. meteorology, weather forecast, other pollutants, time, and station ID are fed into deep distributed fusion network, which adapts DNN to fuse heterogeneous urban data. We first use embedding method to transform the raw features of each domain data into a low-dimensional space for capturing temporal correlation and learning the intra-dynamics. Here, we use the embedding of AQIs to simulate the direct factors from local emission and regional transport and use the embedding of rest datasets as indirect factors respectively. Then, we propose a distributed fusion architecture to simultaneously model the interactions between these factors for learning the individual and holistic influences. As each indirect factor has own effort on direct factors affecting future air quality, we build four subnets (HW, WF, SP, and MP) to capture the individual influences from the historical weather, weather forecast, secondary productions, and meta properties from time and terrain, respectively. Besides individual influences, we build a subnet (HI) to learn the holistic influence by fusing all direct and indirect factors together. After that, the outputs of five subnets are aggregated by weighted merge to capture the high-level effects of these factors. Finally, the aggregation is mapped into [0, 1] by a Sigmoid function to generate final prediction results.",

Frequent NPF events have been observed in heavily polluted urban environments, contributing to the aerosol number concentration by a significant amount. The Po Valley region in northern Italy has been characterized as a hotspot for high aerosol loadings and frequent NPF events in southern Europe. However, the mechanisms of NPF and growth in this region are not completely understood. In this study, we conducted a continuous 2-month measurement campaign with stateof-the-art instruments to elucidate the NPF and growth mechanisms in northern Italy. Our results demonstrate that frequent NPF events (66% of all days during the measurement campaign) are primarily driven by abundant sulfuric acid  $(8.5 \\times 10^6 \\text{ cm}^{-3})$  and basic molecules in this area. In contrast, oxygenated organic molecules from the atmospheric oxidation of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) appear to play a minor role in the initial cluster formation but contribute significantly to the consecutive growth process. Regarding alkaline molecules, amines are insufficient to stabilize all sulfuric acid clusters in the Po Valley. Ion cluster measurements and kinetic models suggest that ammonia (10 ppb) must therefore also play a role in the nucleation process. Generally, the high formation rates of sub-2 nm particles  $(87 \\text{ cm}^{-3} \\text{ s}^{-1})$  and nucleation-mode growth rates  $(5.1 \\text{ nm h}^{-1})$  as well as the relatively low condensational sink  $(8.9 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ s}^{-1})$  will result in a high survival probability for newly formed particles, making NPF crucial for the springtime aerosol number budget.

Efficient nucleation and growth are crucial factors contributing to haze formation, accounting for over 65 % of the particle number concentration in urban environments (Kulmala et al., 2021; Guo et al., 2014; Chu et al., 2019; Sebastian et al., 2022). Strong and frequent NPF events have been reported in the most urbanized areas of China, such as the North China Plain (Wang et al., 2013, 2015; Wu et al., 2007, 2011; Shen et al., 2011), the Yangtze River Delta (Dai et al., 2017; Yu et al., 2016; Xiao et al., 2015) and the Peal River Delta (Yue et al., 2013; Peng et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2008). This observation contradicts theoretical calculations which suggest that NPF events are less likely to occur in polluted areas, where high levels of pre-existing aerosols acting as condensation sinks (CSs) are capable of quickly scavenging gaseous precursors of NPF (Kulmala et al., 2017).",

Certain alkaline molecules, including amines (e.g., dimethylamine – DMA) and ammonia (NH3) have been shown to substantially enhance nucleation and reduce evaporation by stabilizing atmospheric SA in chamber studies (Almeida et al., 2013). Furthermore, oxygenated organic molecules (OOMs) can also contribute to NPF and subsequent particle growth, even without the inclusion of SA (Kirkby et al., 2016; Xiao et al., 2021). As shown in Fig. 3a, most of the measurements were above the SA–NH<sup>3</sup> system at 278 K from the CLOUD chamber, suggesting that the SA–NH<sup>3</sup> mechanism itself cannot solely explain the measured J1.<sup>7</sup> and that other species are most likely participating in NPF in the Po Valley. For instance, amines, such as DMA or trimethylamine (TMA), with higher basicity may contribute to NPF, consistent with non-negligible concentrations of amines in previous studies in the aerosol at SPC (Paglione et al., 2014; Decesari et al., 2014). For the whole sampling period, the median SA and J1.<sup>7</sup> values in the Po Valley follow the SA–DMA–NH<sup>3</sup> (4 ppt DMA and 1 ppb NH3) and SA–DMA–NH3–Org (adding additional oxidized aromatic organics; Xiao et al., 2021) lines from the CLOUD chamber at 293 K, even though the average noontime temperature was around 285 K during most of the NPF days (Fig. 3a).",

The values in parentheses represent the respective 25th and 75th percentiles of data (Fig. 3c). Growth rates increase with particle diameter, which is a phenomenon also observed in other campaigns around the world (Kontkanen et al., 2017; Kulmala et al., 2013), typically indicative of an increasing organic vapor contribution with size (e.g., Stolzenburg et al., 2018). The growth rates observed here were similar to those observed by Kontkanen et al. (2016) at SPC in summer (7.2 nm  $h^{-1}$  for 7–20 nm). Moreover, our 1.5– 3 nm growth rate matches well with Manninen et al. (2010)  $(1.5 \\text{ nm h}^{-1})$  during spring in the Po Valley. A comparison to predicted growth rates from sulfuric acid condensation without organics, which was calculated based on kinetic collisions of the measured SA concentrations and the effect of van der Waals forces on the collision frequency (Stolzenburg et al., 2020), suggests that sulfuric acid condensation may be, on average, sufficient for the growth of the smallest clusters (Fig. 3c). This supports the argument that sulfuric acid and its stabilizing molecules (likely the bases, such as  $NH_3$  and amines) were controlling particle formation in the initial steps of NPF and growth in the Po Valley. However, for particles to grow beyond 3 nm in size, other vapors were needed, which was suggested by the significantly lower contribution of growth by SA (indicated by the green line) than the measured GR for  $3-7$  and  $7-15$  nm particles (Fig. 3c). Those vapors were likely a mixture of organics from anthropogenic and biogenic origins (with the latter emitted at higher rates during summer). We compared the GR during NPF with and without growth events using the method proposed in Kulmala et al.  $(2022)$ : the signal was averaged for all classified non-event days and an appearance time fit was then performed for each size channel independently, also revealing a growth pattern. We found no significant difference with respect to the GR in the  $7-15 \\text{ nm}$  size range for NPF with or without growth days ( $\\text{GR} = 5.1 \\text{ nm h}^{-1}$  for NPF with growth days and  $GR = 6.1 \\text{ nm h}^{-1}$  for NPF without growth days). Considering the similar CS and GR levels for NPF with and without growth days, the higher formation rates at  $1.7 \\text{ nm}$  ( $87 \\text{ cm}^{-3} \\text{ s}^{-1}$ ) may be a more important factor to surpass the CS. Under stable meteorological conditions, a higher formation rate may significantly elevate the possibility that newly formed particles overcome the CS and continuously grow to larger sizes.",

At nighttime, the SA concentrations were close to zero due to the scavenging of  $SO_2$  and SA by the high RH (Fig. 1). During our sampling period, large amounts of organics were identified by the CI-APi-ToF. They were typically smaller than 400 Th with carbon numbers  $< 8$  and oxygen numbers  $< 6$  (Fig. S7). Due to the relatively high  $NO_x$  levels (13 ppb) that can terminate the dimerization reactions (Yan et al.,  $2020$ ), no OOM dimers were found, which is different from clean and biogenically dominated environments such as Hyytiälä (Lehtipalo et al., 2018). The compositions of OOMs were similar between NPF and non-NPF days, although with different abundance. Extremely high abundances of nitrophenols and their homologous compounds were found on non-NPF days ( $\\sim 8$  times higher than on NPF days), likely caused by both the enhanced primary, e.g., biomass burning (Mohr et al., 2013) and pesticide usage (Harrison et al., 2005), and secondary, e.g., photochemical and/or aqueous-phase secondary formation, sources (Zheng et al., 2021; Gilardoni et al., 2016).  $C_{2-4}H_{4.5}N_{0.1}O_{3.4}$  compounds were found to be 50 % higher (Fig. S7) on non-NPF days, likely caused by the enhanced heterogeneous reactions that form smaller organics, such as carboxylic acids, under higher-RH conditions. Previous studies have also reported aqueous-phase organic aerosol processing at high RH (Gilardoni et al., 2016) and high concentrations of carboxylic acids, such as formic, oxalic and malonic acids, in the springtime in the Po Valley (Saarikoski et al., 2012). In general, the fraction of the abundance of nitrogen-containing OOMs (CHON) with respect to the total identified OOMs was  $60\\%$ – $70\\%$ , which is close to the levels reported in polluted cities such as Nanjing (Nie et al., 2022) and Beijing (Guo et al., 2022). A slightly higher fraction of CHON compounds  $(73\\%)$  was found during non-NPF days than NPF days (67 %), consistent with higher  $NO_x$ and fine-particulate-matter levels (Fig. S8). This is likely associated with the stagnant meteorological conditions and the accumulation of pollutants during the non-NPF days. However, the overall high amounts of CHON compounds and the lack of organic dimers make it unlikely that OOMs drive the NPF process (both clustering and initial growth; see, e.g., Simon et al., 2020). Their similar abundance on non-NPF and NPF days was also in line with the similar estimated GR for both types of days.",

At nighttime, the SA concentrations were close to zero due to the scavenging of  $SO_2$  and SA by the high RH (Fig. 1). During our sampling period, large amounts of organics were identified by the CI-APi-ToF. They were typically smaller than 400 Th with carbon numbers  $< 8$  and oxygen numbers  $< 6$  (Fig. S7). Due to the relatively high  $NO_x$  levels (13 ppb) that can terminate the dimerization reactions (Yan et al.,  $2020$ ), no OOM dimers were found, which is different from clean and biogenically dominated environments such as Hyytiälä (Lehtipalo et al., 2018).

This involvement of ammonia and other amines differs from Chinese megacities such as Shanghai, where high levels of DMA have been observed (∼ 40 ppt; Yao et al., 2016, 2018). As insufficient DMA is available to stabilize all clusters, we speculate that the clustering is therefore sensitive to the abundance of amines. In that sense, during our sampling period, NPF in the Po Valley seems to be more sensitive to the strength of certain emission sources of amines compared with megacity environments, where abundant DMA has been observed. The abundant OOMs dominate the consecutive growth process, leading to a comparable GRs to Chinese megacities such as Beijing and Shanghai. Due to the relatively lower CS than these megacities, however, the newly formed particles may have a higher survival probability and result in more particles with long-term survival in the Po Valley, indicating a decisive role of NPF in Po Valley aerosol and PM2.<sup>5</sup> concentrations.",

      "paragraph_info": "Valley region, DMA, a typical base in areas influenced anthropogenic emissions, is insufficient to stabilize the high levels of sulfuric acid, leading to the involvement of other alkaline molecules, such as other type of amines and ammonia, likely originating from fertilization in the area. This involvement of ammonia and other amines differs from Chinese megacities such as Shanghai, where high levels of DMA have been observed (∼ 40 ppt; Yao et al., 2016, 2018). As insufficient DMA is available to stabilize all clusters, we speculate that the clustering is therefore sensitive to the abundance of amines. In that sense, during our sampling period, NPF in the Po Valley seems to be more sensitive to the strength of certain emission sources of amines compared with megacity environments, where abundant DMA has been observed. The abundant OOMs dominate the consecutive growth process, leading to a comparable GRs to Chinese megacities such as Beijing and Shanghai. Due to the relatively lower CS than these megacities, however, the newly formed particles may have a higher survival probability and result in more particles with long-term survival in the Po Valley, indicating a decisive role of NPF in Po Valley aerosol and PM2.<sup>5</sup> concentrations.",

      "paragraph_info": "In this study, we conducted a continuous 2-month measurement campaign in the Italian Po Valley during springtime, where frequent NPF events were observed on 66 % of all days. Through direct ion cluster measurement, kinetic models and comparison with the CLOUD chamber experiment, we have determined that sulfuric acid–base nucleation is the dominant formation mechanism in the Po Valley region. Abundant sulfuric acid and alkaline molecules, including amines and ammonia derived from agriculture activities, provided ample precursors for NPF events. In contrast to megacity environments, the CS showed no significant difference between NPF event days and non-event days, indicating that it is more the abundance of precursors than the variations in the sink controlling the occurrence of NPF in the Po Valley. Furthermore, we observed that, apart from DMA, a typical basic precursor, NH<sup>3</sup> and other amines were also likely to be involved in NPF in the Po Valley. This was supported by the high abundance of SA–NH<sup>3</sup> and SA–NH3–amine clusters measured by the APi-ToF during NPF events. DMA, while more efficient than ammonia, was insufficient to stabilize all SA during our sampling period. This resulted in a more scattered correlation between sulfuric acid concentrations and measured formation rates compared with Chinese megacities. In that sense, we could show that the clustering during NPF is clearly distinct between polluted megacity environments and polluted semi-urbanized regions such as the Po Valley. Similar to Beijing, we found that OOMs did not play a decisive role in initial cluster formation, likely due to the absence of ultra-low-volatility organics (typical OOM dimers) in the ion and neutral cluster measurements. However, low-volatility organics were abundant enough to induce fast growth processes above 3 nm. The comparable GRs and formation rates, along with the lower efficient CS compared with megacity environments, indicate a high survival probability for the newly formed particles. Therefore, NPF is likely to play an important role in the fine-particle concentrations and pollution levels in the Po Valley region. Further reductions in key NPF species, including SO2, amines and NH3, can contribute to suppressing the NPF event frequency and lowering particle numbers. This, in turn, would improve air quality in the Po Valley region.",

      "paragraph_info": "First, the assessment of aerosol total ON, including both water-soluble ON (WSON) and water-insoluble ON (WION), has been quite restricted, with most determinations focusing solely on water-soluble TN (WSTN), omitting WION measurements (Cape et al., 2011). This approach produces WSON through taking the difference between WSTN and IN. Some studies have employed elemental analyzers for TN determination, calculating ON as the difference between TN and IN (Duan et al., 2009; Miyazaki et al., 2011; Pavuluri et al., 2015; Matsumoto et al., 2019).

The measurement principle and operational procedure of the TAG system have been described in detail in previous studies (Williams et al., 2006; He et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2021). In brief, the TAG system operated at a time resolution of 2 h. During the first hour, ambient air was drawn through a  $PM_{2.5}$  cyclone at a flow rate of  $10 \\text{ L min}^{-1}$ , passing through a carbon denuder to remove the gas phase, and particles were then collected onto a thermal desorption cell (CTD). In the second hour, the collected particles underwent thermal desorption and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. In each analysis, 5 µL of an internal standard mixture was added to the CTD that was loaded with particles collected in the preceding hour. During the thermal desorption step, the polar organic compounds in the  $PM_{2.5}$  were derivatized to their trimethylsilyl derivatives under a helium stream saturated with the derivatization agent Nmethyl-N-(trimethylsilyl) trifluoroacetamide (MSTFA). Subsequently, the organic compounds were reconcentrated onto a focusing trap cooled by a fan. Following this, the CTD was purged with pure helium to remove excess MSTFA, and the focusing trap was heated to  $330\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  to transfer the organic compounds into the valveless injection system, which utilizes a restrictive capillary tube to connect to the GC inlet. The GC-MS analysis was then initiated. A total of approximately 100 polar and non-polar organic compounds could be identified and quantified with authentic standards (Zhu et al., 2021).

Among the primary sources, coal combustion and vehicle emissions were the most dominant, each contributing 21 % to the aerosol ON. This finding was consistent with the summertime measurements at the same site that vehicle emissions and coal combustion dominated the primary emission sources of ON (Yu et al., 2023). The contribution of coal combustion to ON was higher during nighttime, whereas the contribution of vehicle emissions increased during traffic rush hours (Fig. 2c). In comparison, industrial and dust emissions had relatively lower contributions to ON but showed increased contributions during daytime. Biomass burning has been recognized as an important source of aerosol ON (Mace et al., 2003; Chen and Chen, 2010; Yu et al., 2017). In this study, we found that a negligible fraction of ON was apportioned to the primary biomass burning factor while a notable presence (7.2 %) of ON in the factor of nitrocatechol formation processes (Fig. 2). Nitrocatechols are probably formed through the nitration of catechols emitted from biomass burning. This secondary formation pathway was supported by the good correlation between levoglucosan and nitrocatechols (Fig. S7).

Our results suggest that, under urban atmospheric conditions, the conversion ratio of  $NO_x$ -N to aerosol-phase ON and nitrate-N is approximately  $1:3$ . While this estimate is subject to uncertainties inherent in source apportionment and chemical transformation processes, it provides valuable for evaluating the fate of  $NO_x$  and its partitioning into organic and inorganic aerosol nitrogen.

Organic nitrates have long been recognized as notable components of secondary OAs in ambient air (Rollins et al., 2012; Perring et al., 2013). Organic nitrate formation encompasses two main pathways: hydroxyl radical (OH)-initiated oxidation of hydrocarbons in the presence of  $NO_x$  during the day and nitrate radical ( $NO_3$ )-initiated oxidation of alkenes during the night. Both pathways involve the formation of organic nitrates in the gas phase, followed by partitioning to the particulate phase (Perring et al., 2013).

      "paragraph_info": "Abstract— Air pollution has become a serious public health problem for many cities around the world. To find the causes of air pollution, the propagation processes of air pollutants must be studied at a large spatial scale. However, the complex and dynamic wind fields lead to highly uncertain pollutant transportation. The state-of-the-art data mining approaches cannot fully support the extensive analysis of such uncertain spatiotemporal propagation processes across multiple districts without the integration of domain knowledge. The limitation of these automated approaches motivates us to design and develop AirVis, a novel visual analytics system that assists domain experts in efficiently capturing and interpreting the uncertain propagation patterns of air pollution based on graph visualizations. Designing such a system poses three challenges: a) the extraction of propagation patterns; b) the scalability of pattern presentations; and c) the analysis of propagation processes. To address these challenges, we develop a novel pattern mining framework to model pollutant transportation and extract frequent propagation patterns efficiently from large-scale atmospheric data. Furthermore, we organize the extracted patterns hierarchically based on the minimum description length (MDL) principle and empower expert users to explore and analyze these patterns effectively on the basis of pattern topologies. We demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach through two case studies conducted with a real-world dataset and positive feedback from domain experts.",

To find the causes of air pollution, the propagation processes of air pollutants must be studied at a large spatial scale.

To address these challenges, we develop a novel pattern mining framework to model pollutant transportation and extract frequent propagation patterns efficiently from large-scale atmospheric data. Furthermore, we organize the extracted patterns hierarchically based on the minimum description length (MDL) principle and empower expert users to explore and analyze these patterns effectively on the basis of pattern topologies.

In the pattern graphs illustrated in Fig. [1C](#page-0-0)5 and [1C](#page-0-0)6, two districts, Xinjishi and Xinleshi, were identified as the origins of air pollution. The large sizes of the inner orange circles suggested that these two districts were seriously polluted. Moreover, the pie charts in Fig. [1C](#page-0-0)5 and [1C](#page-0-0)6 indicated that the pollution propagated along two different paths was largely contributed by the pollution in these two districts, which were constantly exposed to the pollution from Shijiazhuang. EA and EB hypothesized that the coal-fired power plants could be a severe air pollution source that had a considerable impact on remote regions. This hypothesis needs to be confirmed with advanced chemical reaction analysis. Moreover, EC also indicated that the pollution in Shijiazhuang might reach northeastern districts, including Beijing and Langfang, via these two paths. Therefore, informed pollution control policies can be made with these patterns, such as suspending a few power plants in Shijiazhuang based on the forecasted wind conditions, which has been proven to be particularly effective [\\[54\\]](#page-10-27).",

EB selected this motif to obtain the associated patterns, where he identified an interesting pattern that occurred in two large cities, Tianjin and Tangshan (Fig. [8A](#page-7-0)1). In the corresponding pattern graph (Fig. [8A](#page-7-0)), the propagation pathways suggested that the pollution in the Binhaixinqu district was likely propagated from the downtown of Tianjin and a remote city, Tangshan. Fig. [8B](#page-7-0) shows the deterioration of air quality among the involved districts is highly correlated in the time ranges enclosed with dashed circles, which confirmed the aforementioned hypothesis.

To address the scalability issue that impedes the perception of significant patterns therein, we organize the propagation graphs in a stratified way that utilizes their innate hierarchy of common topology, frequent patterns, and instances, and design visualizations accordingly to support leveled exploration that imposes less cognitive load on users. Moreover, we visualize the frequent motifs and patterns with carefully designed glyphs that compactly summarize their attributes, empowering users to effectively analyze data from multiple perspectives. The detailed instances are expanded on demand. This approach coincides in spirit with the visual information-seeking mantra [\\[51\\]](#page-9-4) and once again confirms its effectiveness in guiding the exploration of complex datasets.",

      "paragraph_info": "**Abstract:** In recent years, frequent occurrences of significant air pollution events in China have routinely caused panic and are a major topic of discussion by the public and air pollution experts in government and academia. Therefore, this study proposed an efficient visualization method to represent directly, quickly, and clearly the spatio-temporal information contained in air pollution data. Data quality check and cleansing during a preliminary visual analysis is presented in tabular form, heat matrix, or line chart, upon which hypotheses can be deduced. Further visualizations were designed to verify the hypotheses and obtain useful findings. This method was tested and validated in a year-long case study of the air quality index (AQI of PM2.5) in Beijing, China. We found that PM2.5, PM10, and NO<sup>2</sup> may be emitted by the same sources, and strong winds may accelerate the spread of pollutants. The average concentration of PM2.5 in Beijing was greater than the AQI value of 50 over the six-year study period. Furthermore, arable lands exhibited considerably higher concentrations of air pollutants than vegetation-covered areas. The findings of this study showed that our visualization method is intuitive and reliable through data quality checking and information sharing with multi-perspective air pollution graphs. This method allows the data to be easily understood by the public and inspire or aid further studies in other fields.",

This point is different from that of the others. Figure 8 also shows that pollutants and wind speed are negatively correlated; that is, larger wind speed results in lower pollutant concentration. Strong winds will accelerate the spread of pollutants, and a mixture of fresh air may decrease pollutant concentration. Moreover, precipitation has a weak negative correlation with the pollutants. Precipitation can wash the PM<sub>2.5</sub>, which can be replenished very soon in Beijing. Summer and autumn have strong precipitation but there is extremely light rainfall in spring and autumn; this conforms to the sub-humid, warm, temperate, and continental monsoon climate in Beijing [37].",

The southern areas of Beijing have a mix of arable and residential lands, and the air pollution concentrations in the corresponding stations (IDs  $05$ ,  $17-19$ ) have relatively higher AQIs. Stations 34–36 in the south end of Beijing, a major part of which is arable land, show the highest concentrations among other areas of the city. Figures in this section suggest that air pollutants exhibit strong spatial distribution. Vegetation, terrain, and land use influence air contamination. Vegetation can reduce the diffusion of atmospheric pollutants and absorb some pollutants. Arable lands have considerably higher air pollutant concentrations than vegetation-covered areas.",

The complete model is shown in fig. 6 with 1 encoder network and 1 forecasting (decoder) network. Both 2 networks are stacks of many ConvLSTM layers. The output of the forecasting network is then fed into a  $1x1$  convolution layer to produce the final output.  $1 \\times 1$  convolution is called a feature pooling technique where it allows to sum pooling the features across the depth channel while still keeps the spatial characteristic of the feature map. Using  $1x1$  convolution at the last layer before the output layer, we can transform the ConvLSTM networks output volume into the final output with the same 2D dimension. The output also has the grid-based form like the input, and we can use it to determine air quality's values everywhere in the city.",

Intuitively, FC-LSTM model shows the worst output with all the grid-cells except the existing monitoring stations have the same value. The reason is FC-LSTM networks do not learn the spatial features well, and thus do not give good interpolation output. For the remaining 3 models, ConvLSTM and DAL show pretty good air pollution interpolation compared with the CNN Encoder-Decoder model.

The demand for predicting future air quality is becoming increasingly more important to government's policy-making and people's decision making. In this paper, we predict the air quality of next 48 hours for each monitoring station, considering air quality data, meteorology data, and weather forecast data. Based on the domain knowledge about air pollution, we propose a deep neural network (DNN)-based approach (entitled DeepAir), which consists of a spatial transformation component and a deep distributed fusion network. Considering air pollutants' spatial correlations, the former component converts the spatial sparse air quality data into a consistent input to simulate the pollutant sources. The latter network adopts a neural distributed architecture to fuse heterogeneous urban data for simultaneously capturing the factors affecting air quality, e.g. meteorological conditions. We deployed DeepAir in our AirPollutionPrediction system, providing fine-grained air quality forecasts for 300+ Chinese cities every hour. The experimental results on the data from three-year nine Chinese-city demonstrate the advantages of DeepAir beyond 10 baseline methods. Comparing with the previous online approach in AirPollutionPrediction system, we have 2.4%, 12.2%, 63.2% relative accuracy improvements on short-term, long-term and sudden changes prediction, respectively.",

Air pollution consists of a mixture of particulate matter (i.e. PM2.5 and PM10) and gaseous species (i.e. NO<sub>2</sub>, CO, O<sub>3</sub> and SO<sub>2</sub>), which have both acute and chronic effects on human health, especially for young and elderly [2]. From statistical results [3], Beijing recorded 46 days of heavy pollution during 2015, accounting for 12.6 percent of the year. For monitoring real-time air pollution, Chinese governments have built many air quality monitoring stations and published air quality data every hour in recent years [4]. Besides monitoring, there is a rising demand for predicting future air quality, which can inform governments' policy-making (such as performing traffic control when the air is polluted seriously) and people's decision making (like whether to exercise outdoors).",

Here, we use the embedding of AQIs to simulate the direct factors from local emission and regional transport and use the embedding of rest datasets as indirect factors respectively. Then, we propose a distributed fusion architecture to simultaneously model the interactions between these factors for learning the individual and holistic influences. As each indirect factor has own effort on direct factors affecting future air quality, we build four subnets (HW, WF, SP, and MP) to capture the individual influences from the historical weather, weather forecast, secondary productions, and meta properties from time and terrain, respectively. Besides individual influences, we build a subnet (HI) to learn the holistic influence by fusing all direct and indirect factors together. After that, the outputs of five subnets are aggregated by weighted merge to capture the high-level effects of these factors. Finally, the aggregation is mapped into [0, 1] by a Sigmoid function to generate final prediction results.",

      "paragraph_info": "As shown in Figure 5(a), air quality monitoring stations (marked as dot) are randomly scattered in geographical space, where color on the dot means the level of air quality. Firstly, we partition the geographical space into 16 regions by four lines and two circles, e.g. 20 km and 100 km semidiameter. As depicted in Figure 5(b), all regions share the target monitoring station (denoted by the black point) as common center and regions in the inner circle have a small area, while regions in the outer circle have a big area. Also, regions with different angles fit eight wind directions, which may be further captured by meteorological conditions. Furthermore, we aggregate the readings of air quality recorded by monitoring stations within the regions, illustrated in Figure 5(c). As a result, regions with at least one station will have one average AQI. However, from the partition results of Beijing, we find that different target stations have different missing patterns and about 33% regions do not have monitoring stations. Thus, we fill the missing values in these regions shown in Figure 5(d). More specifically, we first random generate some fake monitoring stations in these regions. Then, we use a classic spatial interpolation method, inverse distance weighting (IDW) [11], to interpolate the AQI of fake monitoring stations. Considering the readings of geospatially adjacent stations located in both inside and outside the outer circle, IDW assigns a weight to each available reading of geospatially adjacent stations by the distance to target sensor, and then aggregates these weights and readings by weighted average. After that, we aggregate the interpolated values of fake stations to calculate average AQI for the region. Finally, we get 17 AQI in one timestamp which 1 AQI come from target station and 16 AQI come from neighbor regions. We conduct the same process for each monitoring stations along time.",

DeepAir achieves the highest accuracy in both general cases and sudden changes as it can automatically discover complicated air pollution patterns by modeling the underlying complex interactions of direct factors and indirect factors. By considering air quality data recorded by neighbor stations, LSTM-STC outperforms LSTM significantly, which shows the importance of spatial signals. The results of LSTM methods are not good for two reasons. One is that air quality is affected by many complex factors and the other is air quality has temporal closeness without obvious daily/weekly/monthly patterns. Comparing with DeepST, the results show that CNN is not suited in air quality prediction task as air quality data is sparse and the image size is small after preprocessing. As a result, DMVST-Net is not suited as other influential factors are more important than spatio-temporal correlations in the complex environment of air pollution. Comparing with DeepFM, the results show the effectiveness of DeepAir as DeepFM is designed for high-dimensional and extremely sparse data. Thus, a deep understanding of problem and data is important. Comparing with DeepSD, the results show that distributed architecture is more suited for air quality prediction task than sequential architecture as each indirect factor has an individual effect on direct factors affecting future air quality.",

      "paragraph_info": "Figure 8 shows the comparison between DeepAir and previous state-of-the-art online approach, FFA, in AirPollutionPrediction system on 9 major Chinese cities. In general, DeepAir can achieve an average accuracy of (81.1%, 63%, 46%) in (1-6h, 7-48h, sudden changes) for all cities. Comparing with FFA, our approach has a better performance in all nine cities, with 2.4%,  $12.2\\%,\\ 63.2\\%$  relative accuracy improvements on short-term, long-term and sudden changes prediction. The reason behind it is that FFA trains four separate prediction models for modeling influential features respectively, which may fail to capture the interactions among all factors. Also, FFA is a shallow method which cannot capture the underlying complex pattern of each factor. Moreover, the features in FFA is not strong enough as it ignores the dynamic change of weather forecasts.",

Comparing with only using the air quality data from target station, DeepAir has a higher accuracy on general cases and sudden changes as air pollutants are dispersed in geographical space. With the signals from spatial neighbors, DeepAir can capture the dynamic changes of air quality. If we directly fed air quality readings from k-nearest stations (k=17, same size with STC) as inputs, the result is worse than STC. The reason behind it is each station has totally different k-nearest stations, while STC considers spatial correlations and generates a consistent input from eight directions. In STC, we find that inner & outer circles have a better performance than a single inner circle as it considers the signals from distant cities.",

Based on the domain knowledge about air pollution, we adopt a novel distributed fusion architecture to fuse heterogeneous urban data, which can simultaneously capture the individual and holistic effects from all influential factors affecting air quality. Comparing with 10 baselines with three-year data from 9 Chinese cities, our approach achieves a higher accuracy in both general cases and sudden changes. We have deployed DeepAir in AirPollutionPrediction system, providing fine-grained air quality forecasts for 300+ Chinese cities every hour. Comparing with the previous online approach in the system, we have 2.4%, 12.2%, 63.2% relative accuracy improvements on short-term, long-term and sudden changes prediction, respectively.",

      "paragraph_info": "**Abstract.** New particle formation (NPF) is a major source of aerosol particles and cloud condensation nuclei in the troposphere, playing an important role in both air quality and climate. Frequent NPF events have been observed in heavily polluted urban environments, contributing to the aerosol number concentration by a significant amount. The Po Valley region in northern Italy has been characterized as a hotspot for high aerosol loadings and frequent NPF events in southern Europe. However, the mechanisms of NPF and growth in this region are not completely understood. In this study, we conducted a continuous 2-month measurement campaign with stateof-the-art instruments to elucidate the NPF and growth mechanisms in northern Italy. Our results demonstrate that frequent NPF events (66% of all days during the measurement campaign) are primarily driven by abundant sulfuric acid  $(8.5 \\times 10^6 \\text{ cm}^{-3})$  and basic molecules in this area. In contrast, oxygenated organic molecules from the atmospheric oxidation of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) appear to play a minor role in the initial cluster formation but contribute significantly to the consecutive growth process. Regarding alkaline molecules, amines are insufficient to stabilize all sulfuric acid clusters in the Po Valley. Ion cluster measurements and kinetic models suggest that ammonia (10 ppb) must therefore also play a role in the nucleation process. Generally, the high formation rates of sub-2 nm particles  $(87 \\text{ cm}^{-3} \\text{ s}^{-1})$  and nucleation-mode growth rates  $(5.1 \\text{ nm h}^{-1})$  as well as the relatively low condensational sink  $(8.9 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ s}^{-1})$  will result in a high survival probability for newly formed particles, making NPF crucial for the springtime aerosol number budget. Our results also indicate that reducing key pollutants, such as  $SO_2$ , amine and  $NH_3$ , could help to substantially decrease the particle number concentrations in the Po Valley region.",

      "paragraph_info": "frequent high pollution levels, NPF has been reported to be associated with SA along with highly oxygenated organic molecules (HOMs) (Brean et al., 2020). These discrepancies in the reported NPF mechanisms may arise from the limited utilization of state-of-the-art instruments, such as those capable of measuring size distributions down to  $1-2 \\text{ nm}$  as well as directly identifying clusters and vapors, which are influenced by spatiotemporal variations (Wang et al., 2017). Therefore, gaining a better knowledge of the key participants, nucleation mechanisms and roles of pre-existing particles is crucial for comprehending the causes of the high NPF frequencies in polluted regions.

The CI-APi-ToF is an APi-ToF coupled with a CI unit, equipped with a soft X-ray source (L9490, Hamamatsu Photonics,  $9.5 \\,\\mathrm{kV}$ ) to produce the primary ions. The sampling flow went into the instrument through a  $\\sim 0.6 \\text{ m } (0.75 \\text{ in.})$ stainless-steel tube. The sampling flow was 10 LPM and the sheath flow was set to 20 LPM. Data acquisition for CI-APi-ToF was performed with a time resolution of 10 s. A calibration factor of  $1.0 \\times 10^{10} \\text{ cm}^{-3}$  for SA was determined with sampling loss corrections before the campaign according to the method proposed by Kurten et al. (2012).",

From our cluster kinetics simulations, during the peak hours of NPF, DMA concentrations are expected to be in the range of  $0.1$  to  $5 \\text{ ppt}$ , which is lower than the requirement to reach the kinetic limit (Figs. 3b and S3). This implies that other factors, e.g., the abundant ambient NH<sub>3</sub> ( $\\sim 10 \\text{ ppb}$ ) or TMA during our study period, may also participate in cluster formation. This is consistent with the Vocus measurement, which suggests that the ambient DMA signals were close to the background levels (Fig. S4). Possible reasons for not reaching SA-DMA limit during the campaign could be  $(1)$  the relatively lower DMA emissions (such as vehicle flows) than those in Chinese megacities (Ge et al., 2011; Zhu et al., 2022) and (2) the quick scavenging caused by photolysis and nighttime high RH (85 %) (Leng et al., 2015; Yao et al., 2016).

The values in parentheses represent the respective 25th and 75th percentiles of data (Fig. 3c). Growth rates increase with particle diameter, which is a phenomenon also observed in other campaigns around the world (Kontkanen et al., 2017; Kulmala et al., 2013), typically indicative of an increasing organic vapor contribution with size (e.g., Stolzenburg et al., 2018). The growth rates observed here were similar to those observed by Kontkanen et al. (2016) at SPC in summer (7.2 nm  $h^{-1}$  for 7–20 nm). Moreover, our 1.5– 3 nm growth rate matches well with Manninen et al. (2010)  $(1.5 \\text{ nm h}^{-1})$  during spring in the Po Valley. A comparison to predicted growth rates from sulfuric acid condensation without organics, which was calculated based on kinetic collisions of the measured SA concentrations and the effect of van der Waals forces on the collision frequency (Stolzenburg et al., 2020), suggests that sulfuric acid condensation may be, on average, sufficient for the growth of the smallest clusters (Fig. 3c). This supports the argument that sulfuric acid and its stabilizing molecules (likely the bases, such as  $NH_3$  and amines) were controlling particle formation in the initial steps of NPF and growth in the Po Valley. However, for particles to grow beyond 3 nm in size, other vapors were needed, which was suggested by the significantly lower contribution of growth by SA (indicated by the green line) than the measured GR for  $3-7$  and  $7-15$  nm particles (Fig. 3c). Those vapors were likely a mixture of organics from anthropogenic and biogenic origins (with the latter emitted at higher rates during summer). We compared the GR during NPF with and without growth events using the method proposed in Kulmala et al.  $(2022)$ : the signal was averaged for all classified non-event days and an appearance time fit was then performed for each size channel independently, also revealing a growth pattern.

Considering the similar CS and GR levels for NPF with and without growth days, the higher formation rates at  $1.7 \\text{ nm}$  ( $87 \\text{ cm}^{-3} \\text{ s}^{-1}$ ) may be a more important factor to surpass the CS.

The formation rates, growth rates, SA concentrations and CS during NPF in Beijing, Shanghai, Hyytiälä, Jungfraujoch and Chacaltaya are from Deng et al. (2020). The GR calculation range used for comparison varies for different sites: Beijing (GR7–15; Deng et al., 2020), Shanghai (GR7–25; Yao et al., 2018), Nanjing (GR3–20; Yu et al., 2016), Hyytiälä (GR3–20; Vana et al., 2016), Jungfraujoch (GR7–20; Boulon et al., 2010), Chacaltaya (GR7–20; Rose et al., 2015) and Po Valley (GR7–15; this study). The NH3 and DMA concentrations are from the literature (as listed in the Table S1). Half of the limit of detection (LOD) of DMA concentrations in Hyytiälä was applied in panel (d) (Hemmilä et al., 2018). DMA concentrations in the Po Valley were presented as the detection limit reported by Wang et al. (2020) with large uncertainties, as they were not quantified in this study (Fig. S4, Table S1).",

      "paragraph_info": "The field measurement was conducted in Shanghai, a megacity located in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region of China and with a population of over 24 million. In recent years, the city has experienced frequent episodes of  $PM_{2.5}$  pollution, with nitrogenous components becoming increasingly prominent contributors to  $PM_{2.5}$  mass (Zhou et al., 2022). All measurements were carried out at a monitoring site (31.17°N,  $121.43^{\\circ} \\text{E}$ ) situated on the rooftop of an eight-story building, approximately 30 m above the ground, at the Shanghai Academy of Environmental Sciences (SAES). This site is surrounded by urban roads, commercial activities, and residential dwellings, making it a representative urban location influenced by a diverse range of emission sources (Wang et al., 2018; Zhou et al., 2022). The observations were conducted during the fall-winter period from 6 November to 31 December 2021.",

In brief, the analyzer system integrates two commercial instruments: an online aerosol carbon (C) analyzer and a chemiluminescence  $NO_x$  analyzer. Carbonaceous and nitrogenous aerosols collected on quartz filters were thermally evolved under programmed temperatures and then catalytically oxidized to  $CO_2$  and nitrogen oxides ( $NO_{\\nu}$ ), respectively. The C signal was monitored using the non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) method, while the N signal was recorded through chemiluminescence detection after converting  $NO_{\\nu}$  to NO. The C signal assists in differentiating IN and ON components since ON aerosols produce both C and N signals, while the IN fraction only gives an N signal. The programmed thermal evolution facilitates the separation of aerosol IN and ON, as they exhibit distinct thermal characteristics.

      "paragraph_info": "The formation of ON compounds associated with oxygenated cooking OA probably involves the reactive uptake of N2O<sup>5</sup> / NO<sup>3</sup> radicals by unsaturated fatty acid particles, leading to the production of organic nitrates (Gross et al., 2009; Zhao et al., 2011). The combined contribution from the two cooking-related factors was particularly pronounced during dinnertime, reaching 17 ± 10 %. It is noted that the study-wide average contributions to ON from cooking emission and their oxidation product factors were much lower at noon compared to evening (Fig. 2). This difference might be attributed to the lower cooking emissions and/or more favorable dispersion conditions during lunchtime. It is also of note that the study-wide average contributions shown in Fig. 2 obscure the diel variation patterns on individual days. To address this, we examined the day-by-day variations of cooking emission-related tracers. On many days, both unsaturated fatty acids (indicative of primary cooking emissions) and azelaic acid (a marker of oxygenated cooking OA) exhibited bimodal peaks during lunchtime and dinnertime. Fig. S8 highlights five representative days in which the concentrations of these tracers, along with their associated-ON contributions, clearly showed maxima at both mealtime periods.",

This interpretation is supported by correlation analysis, where ON showed stronger associations with  $NO_x$  $(R^2 = 0.45)$  and nitrate  $(R^2 = 0.39)$  than with isoprene- and  $\\alpha$ -pinene-derived SOA tracers ( $R^2 = 0.18-0.19$ ).

This oxidized ON accounted for 4 %-68 % (25 % on average) of the total oxidized N (oxidized ON plus nitrate-N) (Fig. S10b). Both oxidized ON and inorganic nitrate are formed from nitrogen oxides  $(NO_x)$ , indicating shared precursors and partially overlapping formation pathways. Our results suggest that, under urban atmospheric conditions, the conversion ratio of  $NO_x$ -N to aerosol-phase ON and nitrate-N is approximately  $1:3$ . While this estimate is subject to uncertainties inherent in source apportionment and chemical transformation processes, it provides valuable for evaluating the fate of  $NO_x$  and its partitioning into organic and inorganic aerosol nitrogen.

This fraction of SON may indicate the formation of organic nitrates, which share common precursor of  $NO_x$  with nitrate. Organic nitrates have long been recognized as notable components of secondary OAs in ambient air (Rollins et al., 2012; Perring et al., 2013). Organic nitrate formation encompasses two main pathways: hydroxyl radical (OH)-initiated oxidation of hydrocarbons in the presence of  $NO_x$  during the day and nitrate radical ( $NO_3$ )-initiated oxidation of alkenes during the night. Both pathways involve the formation of organic nitrates in the gas phase, followed by partitioning to the particulate phase (Perring et al., 2013). This study, through integrated analyses of SON and SOC, provides evidence suggesting that organic nitrates might also form through heterogeneous or aqueous reactions. As depicted in Fig. 4, the nitrate formation process produced  $0.17 \\,\\mu\\text{g N m}^{-3}$  of  $\\Delta\\text{SON}$  and  $0.43 \\,\\mu\\text{g C m}^{-3}$  of  $\\Delta\\text{SOC}$  from the night of 20 December to the following morning, yielding a  $\\Delta$ SOC /  $\\Delta$ SON atomic ratio of only 2.9. Gas-phase formation of organic nitrates followed by gas-to-particle partitioning would not result in such a low  $C/N$  ratio. Therefore, a large number of organic nitrates might be formed through heterogeneous or aqueous reactions between organic compounds and  $\\text{HNO}_3 / \\text{NO}_3$ , enhancing the ON content while not affecting the OC content which is already present in the particle phase. In a previous study, it was suggested that organic nitrates can be produced through non-radical reactions of hydrated glyoxal and nitric acid in the aqueous phase (Lim et al., 2016). Xu et al. (2020) found that aerosol liquid water promotes the formation of water-soluble ON, probably in the form of organic nitrate species. Previous studies have identified an 80 % underestimation of monoterpene hydroxyl nitrate by the GEOS-Chem model, which considers both OH oxidation and  $NO_3$  oxidation mechanisms of monoterpene (Li et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2021), indicating an incomplete understanding of the formation mechanisms of organic nitrates. Our observational results, combined with previous investigations, suggest the need for further exploration of the formation mechanisms of particulate organic nitrates, such as heterogeneous/aqueous phase reaction processes.",

      "paragraph_info": "Abstract— Air pollution has become a serious public health problem for many cities around the world. To find the causes of air pollution, the propagation processes of air pollutants must be studied at a large spatial scale. However, the complex and dynamic wind fields lead to highly uncertain pollutant transportation. The state-of-the-art data mining approaches cannot fully support the extensive analysis of such uncertain spatiotemporal propagation processes across multiple districts without the integration of domain knowledge. The limitation of these automated approaches motivates us to design and develop AirVis, a novel visual analytics system that assists domain experts in efficiently capturing and interpreting the uncertain propagation patterns of air pollution based on graph visualizations. Designing such a system poses three challenges: a) the extraction of propagation patterns; b) the scalability of pattern presentations; and c) the analysis of propagation processes. To address these challenges, we develop a novel pattern mining framework to model pollutant transportation and extract frequent propagation patterns efficiently from large-scale atmospheric data. Furthermore, we organize the extracted patterns hierarchically based on the minimum description length (MDL) principle and empower expert users to explore and analyze these patterns effectively on the basis of pattern topologies. We demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach through two case studies conducted with a real-world dataset and positive feedback from domain experts.",

In the pattern graphs illustrated in Fig. [1C](#page-0-0)5 and [1C](#page-0-0)6, two districts, Xinjishi and Xinleshi, were identified as the origins of air pollution. The large sizes of the inner orange circles suggested that these two districts were seriously polluted. Moreover, the pie charts in Fig. [1C](#page-0-0)5 and [1C](#page-0-0)6 indicated that the pollution propagated along two different paths was largely contributed by the pollution in these two districts, which were constantly exposed to the pollution from Shijiazhuang. EA and EB hypothesized that the coal-fired power plants could be a severe air pollution source that had a considerable impact on remote regions. This hypothesis needs to be confirmed with advanced chemical reaction analysis. Moreover, EC also indicated that the pollution in Shijiazhuang might reach northeastern districts, including Beijing and Langfang, via these two paths. Therefore, informed pollution control policies can be made with these patterns, such as suspending a few power plants in Shijiazhuang based on the forecasted wind conditions, which has been proven to be particularly effective [\\[54\\]](#page-10-27).",

Therefore, this study proposed an efficient visualization method to represent directly, quickly, and clearly the spatio-temporal information contained in air pollution data. Data quality check and cleansing during a preliminary visual analysis is presented in tabular form, heat matrix, or line chart, upon which hypotheses can be deduced. Further visualizations were designed to verify the hypotheses and obtain useful findings. This method was tested and validated in a year-long case study of the air quality index (AQI of PM2.5) in Beijing, China. We found that PM2.5, PM10, and NO<sup>2</sup> may be emitted by the same sources, and strong winds may accelerate the spread of pollutants. The average concentration of PM2.5 in Beijing was greater than the AQI value of 50 over the six-year study period. Furthermore, arable lands exhibited considerably higher concentrations of air pollutants than vegetation-covered areas. The findings of this study showed that our visualization method is intuitive and reliable through data quality checking and information sharing with multi-perspective air pollution graphs.

In this section, plots are used to visualize and explore the relationships between the pollutants and weather using the U-Air data. Figure 8 shows that the three pollutants are strongly positively correlated because the Pearson's  $r$  values are rather high. However, wind speed has a negative correlation with  $PM_{2.5}$ ,  $PM_{10}$ , and  $NO_2$ , which have high negative *r* values. Precipitation exhibits an extremely weak negative correlation with the pollutants. The strong positive correlation between  $PM_{2.5}$  and  $PM_{10}$ shown in Figure 8 verifies the findings in [7]. Because  $PM_{2.5}$  and  $PM_{10}$  are defined as particles with diameters of 2.5 µm or less and 10 µm or less, respectively, the relationship reveals that the particle density distributed stably according to their sizes. The positive correlation between pollutants indicates that  $PM_{2.5}$ ,  $PM_{10}$ , and  $NO_2$  may be emitted by the same sources, or one may be emitted by the transformation of another through some type of chemical mechanism [38]. To determine the specific reasons, a combined physical and chemical analysis of pollutants is desirable [19].",

Predicting air quality for any regions and at any time is a critical requirement of urban citizens. However, air pollution prediction for the whole city is a challenging problem. The reason is, there are many spatiotemporal factors affecting air pollution throughout the city. Collecting as many of them could help us to forecast air pollution better. In this research, we present many spatiotemporal datasets collected over Seoul city in Korea, which is currently much suffered by air pollution problem as well. These datasets include air pollution data, meteorological data, traffic volume, average driving speed, and air pollution indexes of external areas which are known to impact Seoul's air pollution. To the best of our knowledge, traffic volume and average driving speed data are two new datasets in air pollution research. In addition, recent research in air pollution has tried to build models to interpolate and predict air pollution in the city. Nevertheless, they mostly focused on predicting air quality in discrete locations or used hand-crafted spatial and temporal features. In this paper, we propose the usage of Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) model [\\[16\\]](#page-7-0), a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks and Long Short-Term Memory, which automatically manipulates both the spatial and temporal features of the data. Specially, we introduce how to transform the air pollution data into sequences of images which leverages the using of ConvLSTM model to interpolate and predict air quality for the entire city at the same time. We prove that our approach is suitable for spatiotemporal air pollution problems and also outperforms other related research.",

      "paragraph_info": "With the rapid development of urbanization, air pollution is becoming a severe environmental and societal issue for all developing countries around the world [1]. Air pollution consists of a mixture of particulate matter (i.e. PM2.5 and PM10) and gaseous species (i.e. NO<sub>2</sub>, CO, O<sub>3</sub> and SO<sub>2</sub>), which have both acute and chronic effects on human health, especially for young and elderly [2]. From statistical results [3], Beijing recorded 46 days of heavy pollution during 2015, accounting for 12.6 percent of the year. For monitoring real-time air pollution, Chinese governments have built many air quality monitoring stations and published air quality data every hour in recent years [4]. Besides monitoring, there is a rising demand for predicting future air quality, which can inform governments' policy-making (such as performing traffic control when the air is polluted seriously) and people's decision making (like whether to exercise outdoors).",

For capturing such individual and holistic influences, we propose a distributed fusion architecture as shown in Figure 6(a), which main feature fuses each auxiliary feature in a parallel manner, and then merge the outputs together. The key point in distributed fusion architecture is that we specify one feature as main feature and other features as auxiliary features. The reason for this partition is main feature and prediction target come from the same domain, while auxiliary features and prediction target come from different domains.

For hourly station-level, we split the predictions of WFM to hourly station-level by considering the average of min-max range; for district-level, we merge the predictions of DeepAir to district-level and get the min-max range for the next 12 hours. In both evaluation settings, DeepAir has a higher accuracy than WFM. In addition, DeepAir has a finer spatial and temporal granularity, a farther prediction period and a faster updating frequency. From the results, we can also find DeepAir has a good performance on 12-hour district-level min-max prediction, which means DeepAir is robust and general enough for other prediction settings.",

If we directly fed air quality readings from k-nearest stations (k=17, same size with STC) as inputs, the result is worse than STC.

Specifically with respect to the distinct features of the Po Valley compared with the more intensely researched megacity environments, a deeper understanding of frequent NPF events, including their precursors, nucleation mechanisms and growth processes, is crucial for air pollution control and the effective implementation of  $PM_{2.5}$  mitigation measures in such a semi-urban but highly industrialized region. In this study, we conducted a 2-month field campaign in the months of March and April 2022. During this field campaign, we  $(1)$  identified the chemical composition of atmospheric neutral and ion clusters using a set of state-ofthe-art mass spectrometers,  $(2)$  characterized the initial NPF and further growth rates using particle number size distribution measurements down to  $1 \\text{ nm}$ , and (3) compared the field measurement results with the recent Cosmics Leaving Outdoor Droplets (CLOUD) chamber experiments to investigate the mechanism of NPF events in the Po Valley region. This allowed us to elucidate the NPF and growth mechanisms at a polluted southern European site and to give insights into the best mitigation strategies for ultrafine particle pollution in the context of already implemented  $PM_{2.5}$  reduction strategies.",

Moreover, our 1.5– 3 nm growth rate matches well with Manninen et al. (2010)  $(1.5 \\text{ nm h}^{-1})$  during spring in the Po Valley. A comparison to predicted growth rates from sulfuric acid condensation without organics, which was calculated based on kinetic collisions of the measured SA concentrations and the effect of van der Waals forces on the collision frequency (Stolzenburg et al., 2020), suggests that sulfuric acid condensation may be, on average, sufficient for the growth of the smallest clusters (Fig. 3c). This supports the argument that sulfuric acid and its stabilizing molecules (likely the bases, such as  $NH_3$  and amines) were controlling particle formation in the initial steps of NPF and growth in the Po Valley. However, for particles to grow beyond 3 nm in size, other vapors were needed, which was suggested by the significantly lower contribution of growth by SA (indicated by the green line) than the measured GR for  $3-7$  and  $7-15$  nm particles (Fig. 3c). Those vapors were likely a mixture of organics from anthropogenic and biogenic origins (with the latter emitted at higher rates during summer). We compared the GR during NPF with and without growth events using the method proposed in Kulmala et al.  $(2022)$ : the signal was averaged for all classified non-event days and an appearance time fit was then performed for each size channel independently, also revealing a growth pattern. We found no significant difference with respect to the GR in the  $7-15 \\text{ nm}$  size range for NPF with or without growth days ( $\\text{GR} = 5.1 \\text{ nm h}^{-1}$  for NPF with growth days and  $GR = 6.1 \\text{ nm h}^{-1}$  for NPF without growth days).

The detection of other SA-B besides SA-DMA clusters indicates that other candidate bases could also play a crucial role in the complex atmosphere for nucleation.

      "paragraph_info": "In this study, we conducted a continuous 2-month measurement campaign in the Italian Po Valley during springtime, where frequent NPF events were observed on 66 % of all days. Through direct ion cluster measurement, kinetic models and comparison with the CLOUD chamber experiment, we have determined that sulfuric acid–base nucleation is the dominant formation mechanism in the Po Valley region. Abundant sulfuric acid and alkaline molecules, including amines and ammonia derived from agriculture activities, provided ample precursors for NPF events. In contrast to megacity environments, the CS showed no significant difference between NPF event days and non-event days, indicating that it is more the abundance of precursors than the variations in the sink controlling the occurrence of NPF in the Po Valley. Furthermore, we observed that, apart from DMA, a typical basic precursor, NH<sup>3</sup> and other amines were also likely to be involved in NPF in the Po Valley. This was supported by the high abundance of SA–NH<sup>3</sup> and SA–NH3–amine clusters measured by the APi-ToF during NPF events. DMA, while more efficient than ammonia, was insufficient to stabilize all SA during our sampling period. This resulted in a more scattered correlation between sulfuric acid concentrations and measured formation rates compared with Chinese megacities. In that sense, we could show that the clustering during NPF is clearly distinct between polluted megacity environments and polluted semi-urbanized regions such as the Po Valley. Similar to Beijing, we found that OOMs did not play a decisive role in initial cluster formation, likely due to the absence of ultra-low-volatility organics (typical OOM dimers) in the ion and neutral cluster measurements. However, low-volatility organics were abundant enough to induce fast growth processes above 3 nm. The comparable GRs and formation rates, along with the lower efficient CS compared with megacity environments, indicate a high survival probability for the newly formed particles. Therefore, NPF is likely to play an important role in the fine-particle concentrations and pollution levels in the Po Valley region. Further reductions in key NPF species, including SO2, amines and NH3, can contribute to suppressing the NPF event frequency and lowering particle numbers. This, in turn, would improve air quality in the Po Valley region.",

Furthermore, we observed that, apart from DMA, a typical basic precursor, NH<sup>3</sup> and other amines were also likely to be involved in NPF in the Po Valley. This was supported by the high abundance of SA–NH<sup>3</sup> and SA–NH3–amine clusters measured by the APi-ToF during NPF events. DMA, while more efficient than ammonia, was insufficient to stabilize all SA during our sampling period. This resulted in a more scattered correlation between sulfuric acid concentrations and measured formation rates compared with Chinese megacities. In that sense, we could show that the clustering during NPF is clearly distinct between polluted megacity environments and polluted semi-urbanized regions such as the Po Valley. Similar to Beijing, we found that OOMs did not play a decisive role in initial cluster formation, likely due to the absence of ultra-low-volatility organics (typical OOM dimers) in the ion and neutral cluster measurements. However, low-volatility organics were abundant enough to induce fast growth processes above 3 nm. The comparable GRs and formation rates, along with the lower efficient CS compared with megacity environments, indicate a high survival probability for the newly formed particles. Therefore, NPF is likely to play an important role in the fine-particle concentrations and pollution levels in the Po Valley region. Further reductions in key NPF species, including SO2, amines and NH3, can contribute to suppressing the NPF event frequency and lowering particle numbers. This, in turn, would improve air quality in the Po Valley region.",

For example, nitroaromatic compounds (Laskin et al., 2015; Xie et al., 2017) and imidazole-like species (Bones et al., 2010; Li et al., 2019) are typical brown carbon molecules that absorb solar radiation, leading to a warming effect. Amines are more efficient than ammonia (NH3) in reacting with sulfuric acid to form new particles (Qiu et al., 2011), even in urban regions with high aerosol loading (Yao et al., 2018). Nitro-polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (nitro-PAHs) are known toxicants to the human body (Miller-Schulze et al., 2010; Bandowe and Meusel, 2017). Additionally, the atmospheric deposition of organic nitrogen (ON) species serves as a significant source of N nutrient for marine and remote continental regions (Kielland et al., 2006; Andersen et al., 2017; Li et al., 2023).

This percentage was significantly lower than  $(p<0.001)$  the value (25 %) observed at the same location during the summer of 2021 (Yu et al., 2023). The difference was attributed to the higher enhancement of IN (2.2 $\\times$ ) compared to ON (1.8 $\\times$ ) from summer to winter. During the winter observation, ON exhibited significantly higher concentrations at nighttime  $(0.85 \\,\\mu\\text{g N m}^{-3})$ compared to daytime (0.75  $\\mu$ g N m<sup>-3</sup>) ( $p$ <0.005) (Fig. 1). This result contradicted the findings from summertime measurements, which showed higher ON concentrations during daytime (Yu et al., 2023). From summer to winter, the daytime and nighttime ON concentrations increased by a factor of 1.56 and 2.13, respectively, suggesting that nocturnal formation of ON aerosols might be more significant in winter. The concentration of aerosol IN was higher during nighttime in both summer and winter periods at the urban site.",

Among the primary sources, coal combustion and vehicle emissions were the most dominant, each contributing 21 % to the aerosol ON. This finding was consistent with the summertime measurements at the same site that vehicle emissions and coal combustion dominated the primary emission sources of ON (Yu et al., 2023). The contribution of coal combustion to ON was higher during nighttime, whereas the contribution of vehicle emissions increased during traffic rush hours (Fig. 2c). In comparison, industrial and dust emissions had relatively lower contributions to ON but showed increased contributions during daytime. Biomass burning has been recognized as an important source of aerosol ON (Mace et al., 2003; Chen and Chen, 2010; Yu et al., 2017). In this study, we found that a negligible fraction of ON was apportioned to the primary biomass burning factor while a notable presence (7.2 %) of ON in the factor of nitrocatechol formation processes (Fig. 2). Nitrocatechols are probably formed through the nitration of catechols emitted from biomass burning. This secondary formation pathway was supported by the good correlation between levoglucosan and nitrocatechols (Fig. S7). The contribution of primary cooking emissions to ON was generally low, averaging 2 % across the observation period. However, this contribution increased to 5 ± 4 % (ranging from 0.8 % to 17 %) during dinner time (Fig. 2).",

This oxidized ON accounted for 4 %-68 % (25 % on average) of the total oxidized N (oxidized ON plus nitrate-N) (Fig. S10b). Both oxidized ON and inorganic nitrate are formed from nitrogen oxides  $(NO_x)$ , indicating shared precursors and partially overlapping formation pathways. Our results suggest that, under urban atmospheric conditions, the conversion ratio of  $NO_x$ -N to aerosol-phase ON and nitrate-N is approximately  $1:3$ . While this estimate is subject to uncertainties inherent in source apportionment and chemical transformation processes, it provides valuable for evaluating the fate of  $NO_x$  and its partitioning into organic and inorganic aerosol nitrogen. These findings underscore the importance of quantifying bulk ON to fully characterize the abundance and chemical nature of N-containing OAs.",

Organic nitrates have long been recognized as notable components of secondary OAs in ambient air (Rollins et al., 2012; Perring et al., 2013). Organic nitrate formation encompasses two main pathways: hydroxyl radical (OH)-initiated oxidation of hydrocarbons in the presence of  $NO_x$  during the day and nitrate radical ( $NO_3$ )-initiated oxidation of alkenes during the night. Both pathways involve the formation of organic nitrates in the gas phase, followed by partitioning to the particulate phase (Perring et al., 2013).

Both pathways involve the formation of organic nitrates in the gas phase, followed by partitioning to the particulate phase (Perring et al., 2013). This study, through integrated analyses of SON and SOC, provides evidence suggesting that organic nitrates might also form through heterogeneous or aqueous reactions. As depicted in Fig. 4, the nitrate formation process produced  $0.17 \\,\\mu\\text{g N m}^{-3}$  of  $\\Delta\\text{SON}$  and  $0.43 \\,\\mu\\text{g C m}^{-3}$  of  $\\Delta\\text{SOC}$  from the night of 20 December to the following morning, yielding a  $\\Delta$ SOC /  $\\Delta$ SON atomic ratio of only 2.9. Gas-phase formation of organic nitrates followed by gas-to-particle partitioning would not result in such a low  $C/N$  ratio. Therefore, a large number of organic nitrates might be formed through heterogeneous or aqueous reactions between organic compounds and  $\\text{HNO}_3 / \\text{NO}_3$ , enhancing the ON content while not affecting the OC content which is already present in the particle phase. In a previous study, it was suggested that organic nitrates can be produced through non-radical reactions of hydrated glyoxal and nitric acid in the aqueous phase (Lim et al., 2016). Xu et al. (2020) found that aerosol liquid water promotes the formation of water-soluble ON, probably in the form of organic nitrate species. Previous studies have identified an 80 % underestimation of monoterpene hydroxyl nitrate by the GEOS-Chem model, which considers both OH oxidation and  $NO_3$  oxidation mechanisms of monoterpene (Li et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2021), indicating an incomplete understanding of the formation mechanisms of organic nitrates. Our observational results, combined with previous investigations, suggest the need for further exploration of the formation mechanisms of particulate organic nitrates, such as heterogeneous/aqueous phase reaction processes.",

To find the causes of air pollution, the propagation processes of air pollutants must be studied at a large spatial scale. However, the complex and dynamic wind fields lead to highly uncertain pollutant transportation. The state-of-the-art data mining approaches cannot fully support the extensive analysis of such uncertain spatiotemporal propagation processes across multiple districts without the integration of domain knowledge. The limitation of these automated approaches motivates us to design and develop AirVis, a novel visual analytics system that assists domain experts in efficiently capturing and interpreting the uncertain propagation patterns of air pollution based on graph visualizations. Designing such a system poses three challenges: a) the extraction of propagation patterns; b) the scalability of pattern presentations; and c) the analysis of propagation processes. To address these challenges, we develop a novel pattern mining framework to model pollutant transportation and extract frequent propagation patterns efficiently from large-scale atmospheric data. Furthermore, we organize the extracted patterns hierarchically based on the minimum description length (MDL) principle and empower expert users to explore and analyze these patterns effectively on the basis of pattern topologies. We demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach through two case studies conducted with a real-world dataset and positive feedback from domain experts.",

      "paragraph_info": "Air composition analysis and remote-sensing methods require complex computations and are time consuming. Moreover, the current graphical approaches for air pollution analysis lack interactive and sharable multi-perspective visualizations. The public urgently needs rapid and reliable knowledge on air pollution to make daily decisions. Similarly, most of the government staff are not professionals and need intuitive understanding of the conditions before they can execute any actions against the increasingly serious air pollutants. Thus, a visual methodology is needed for efficient and reliable exploration, particularly in the case of air pollution data, to improve the depth, readability, and accuracy of data analysis. We were motivated by the idea of visual thinking and the geovisualization concept [\\[12\\]](#page-18-15), which may be well suited for the exploration of air pollution data. Building on the extensive body of previous work, our paper presents a visualization exploration method that realizes the process of observation–hypothesis–verification. This method was tested and validated in a year-long case study of the air quality index (AQI of  $PM_{2.5}$ ) in Beijing, China. The useful findings of air pollution in Beijing show that our new method extends the existing work and fills a gap in the research, focusing on visual exploration to support various applications, such as knowledge-based decision making and aided research of air pollution.",

To minimize the effect of these missing data in the analysis, we separated the data into two parts and outlined them in Table 1. The first strategy involves the time pattern analysis of  $PM_{2.5}$  for stations 01–22 for all months. This analysis includes visualizing the average AQI of  $PM_{2.5}$  by month, day, and hour. The second strategy is spatial distribution analysis of  $PM_{2.5}$  for observations in January, February, November, and December because all stations in these months have complete data records. With this separated analysis, more reliable exploration can be performed.",

Figure 9a shows a circular heat map with average AQI for every month in selected years, whereas Figure 9b represents 24-h periods for selected years. Basing on the charts, AQIs of not less than 150 apparently occurred in January and February, whereas AQIs of more than 100 occurred in September, October, January, and February. Moreover, the AQIs of more than 100 were concentrated from 6:00 p.m. to 4:00 a.m. during the selected years.",
