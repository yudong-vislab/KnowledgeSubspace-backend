      "paragraph_info": "Abstract— The spatial time series generated by city sensors allow us to observe urban phenomena like environmental pollution and traffic congestion at an unprecedented scale. However, recovering causal relations from these observations to explain the sources of urban phenomena remains a challenging task because these causal relations tend to be time- varying and demand proper time series partitioning for effective analyses. The prior approaches extract one causal graph given long- time observations, which cannot be directly applied to capturing, interpreting, and validating dynamic urban causality. This paper presents Compass, a novel visual analytics approach for in- depth analyses of the dynamic causality in urban time series. To develop Compass, we identify and address three challenges: detecting urban causality, interpreting dynamic causal relations, and unveiling suspicious causal relations. First, multiple causal graphs over time among urban time series are obtained with a causal detection framework extended from the Granger causality test. Then, a dynamic causal graph visualization is designed to reveal the time- varying causal relations across these causal graphs and facilitate the exploration of the graphs along the time. Finally, a tailored multi- dimensional visualization is developed to support the identification of spurious causal relations, thereby improving the reliability of causal analyses. The effectiveness of Compass is evaluated with two case studies conducted on the real- world urban datasets, including the air pollution and traffic speed datasets, and positive feedback was received from domain experts."

Such causal relations can reveal the latent temporal interactions between the sensors where the urban time series are collected, facilitating the effective sense- making of urban phenomena and the informed policy- making for better sustainability [86]. For example, if the pollutant readings at sensors  $A$  and  $B$  are identified to cause a considerable increase in those at sensor  $C$  consistently, proper measures should be taken to control the pollution at  $A$  and  $B$  rather than  $C$ ."

Recent studies [38, 89] have investigated applying the Granger causality test to capture the causal relations among urban time series. Based on a set of urban time series, these studies attempt to extract a causal graph, where each cause- effect relation between a pair of sensors is represented with a directed edge. However, one causal graph is insufficient to characterize the dynamic causal relations among multiple urban time series due to the rapidly- changing urban environments. For example, a causal relation between two sensors detected based on their time series can disappear or even be flipped from time to time (Fig. 2a) because of certain external factors, such as the wind fields in the air pollution scenarios. Such a dynamic nature demands fine- grained causality analyses that enable analysts to gain insights into the temporal variations of causal relations in urban contexts. In addition to the limitation of granularity in the prior studies, interpreting and validating these causal relations detected by automated models also require an interactive system to integrate analysts in the urban causality analysis loop [76]."

EA and EB are urban computing experts who have decades of experience studying data- driven solutions for urban problems. EC is a researcher with expertise in causal analyses. We together attempt to apply causal analysis to solve the urban problems. As a statistical analysis method, causal analysis is not limited to computer scientists but can be accepted by urban practitioners with statistical knowledge."

In terms of application, the two real- world case studies have demonstrated that Compass can be easily applied to the urban time series data from different domains. Other potential applications include analyzing noise pollution [9], water pollution [1], and complex physical systems (e.g., IoT systems of tree ecosystem services [46]). For example, a river can be polluted by its upstream tributaries. Compass can help identify when the river is polluted and reveal which tributaries pollute it for each period when the pollution events are observed. In terms of visual analytics, Compass can be regarded as a model- free visual analytics approach and is not limited to the Granger causality test. Granger causality test is currently the most suitable method for our problem because of its wide use, interpretability, and ability to detect causality based on short partitioned time series. However, some recognized issues of the Granger causality test still exist. For example, it is a linear model [27]. Any better model proposed in the future can be easily integrated into our visual analytics system."

However, analyzing the complex graphs in a spatiotemporal context is challenging.

It also becomes difficult to clearly reveal the temporal variations of the detected causalities as the number of edges increases.

This study compared the optimization effects of these two methods and developed a new scheme that combines DA and BC simultaneously. Four parallel experiments were conducted during winter 2019: a control experiment directly forecasted by WRF- Chem (experiment name: WRF- Chem); an experiment that assimilated in situ observations based on the GSI (Gridpoint Statistical Interpolation) system (WRF- Chem_DA); an experiment with deep- learning- based BC (WRF- Chem_BC); and an experiment considering the combination of DA on the initial conditions and BC (WRF- Chem_DA_BC). Statistically, the accuracy of  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  predictions could be optimized by both DA and BC for the first 24- h period, and WRF- Chem_BC performed better than WRF- Chem_DA in the initial field, especially in the period of 10–24 h, while the best performance was achieved by combining BC and DA. Throughout the initial 24- h period, compared with the control experiment, the results of WRF- Chem_DA_BC (WRF- Chem_DA, WRF- Chem_BC) showed an improvement in terms of root- mean- square error, with reduction proportions varying from 38.90% to 48.86% (18.88% to 32.44%, 30.10% to 46.08%). Besides having the best optimization effect over the whole domain, the combined method also performed well in different regions: during the forecasting period of 0–24 h, the RMSEs decreased from 32% to 62%, 39% to 57%, 28% to 40%, and 30% to 49% in the Beijing- Tianjin- Hebei, Yangtze River Delta, Central China, and Sichuan Basin urban agglomerations, respectively."

Therefore, in this study, we considered the two different techniques of DA on the initial conditions and BC separately, and compared their abilities to optimize and enhance the forecasting of  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  concentrations. Besides, a new scheme that combines DA on the initial conditions and BC simultaneously was developed to further improve  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  predictions. The winter of 2019 was selected as the study period, and different comparative experiments were designed to evaluate and analyze the effects on optimizing the  $\\mathrm{PM}_{2.5}$  concentration forecasts."

From the scatter fitting analysis results, WRF- Chem_DA_BC performed best in its consistency with observations following optimization. The results predicted directly by WRF- Chem in the control experiment were dispersed, with some isolated overestimation and underestimation scatter points fitted along the slope of 0.56, which demonstrates poor ability in simulating the high- pollution zones. By applying DA, the predictions of WRF- Chem_DA were partially improved, with an increased fitting slope of 0.69, showing less overestimation and underestimation through the adjustment of the initial field. The optimization of WRF- Chem_BC was much more evident than that of WRF- Chem_DA compared with the control experiment since the overestimation of the model was adjusted and the overall scatter distributions were more concentrated. However, there still existed an overall underestimation trend, with a slope of 0.73 after BC, which may not be sufficient for the simulation of strong pollution processes. It can be seen from Fig. 6a and 6d that the results of WRF- Chem_DA_BC were greatly improved by combining the two optimization methods, with the fitted slope of 1.04 being close to the straight line of  $k = 1$ . In this experiment, the  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  predictions were well adjusted and almost all of the high pollution could be captured, showing the best agreement with the observations. Overall, through adjustment of the model input field and correction of the model output, the predictions were effectively improved. It should be noted that the slope values in the control experiment and WRF- Chem_DA are close to those of previous results (Feng et al., 2018; Ma et al., 2024)."

Assessments of these impacts rely heavily on the modeled aerosol absorption from poorly constrained global models and thus exhibit large uncertainties.

Our approach enables identification of error contributions from emission, lifetime, and MAC (mass absorption coefficient) per model, with MAC and emission dominating the AAOD errors over Amazon and Africa, respectively. In addition to primary emissions, our analysis suggests substantial formation of secondary organic aerosols over the Amazon but not over Africa. Furthermore, we find that differences in direct aerosol radiative effects between models decrease by threefold over the BB source and outflow regions after correcting the identified errors. This highlights the potential to greatly reduce the uncertainty in the most uncertain radiative forcing agent."

These findings are supported by flight campaign measurements (22, 23) such as the ObseRvations of Aerosols above CLOUDs and their intEractionS (ORACLES) project (22), suggesting that the overall warming caused by BBA plumes is greater than previously considered, particularly in tropical regions. However, when considering the aerosol composition, global models tend to produce stronger absorption than observed from field and laboratory measurements for a given BC mass mixing ratio (24). The contradiction between the underestimated overall warming and overestimated absorbing capability per unit of BC mass highlights important errors in the emission, composition, and optical properties of absorbing BBA.

This model improvement is also found when validated against independent Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) observations (fig. S12)."

It should be noted that the relationship by (24) was established under the criteria that OA and BC accounted for more than  $85\\%$  of the total aerosol mass (to focus on BBAs). For the AeroCom models, we compare the SSA for total aerosols and the SSA of grid cells with  $\\geq 85\\%$  carbonaceous aerosol components, with small differences being found for most models, especially within the range of the SSA observations (see fig. S20A). This suggests that the SSA for total aerosols during fire seasons could sufficiently represent the aerosol criteria by (24), which allows us to constrain the rBC in the ambient aerosols from SSA on the basis of the observed relationship. Using another regression to link the rBC from ambient aerosols to the emissions (see fig. S20B), we lastly obtain the constrained rBC in emissions and estimate the separate emissions for BC and OA."

The SPRINTARS model presents simulations at the T213 horizontal grid  $(0.5625^{\\circ})$  with 40 vertical hybrid layers (55). Both simulations start in January 2010 with runs before the fire seasons as spin- up, and validations are made during the fire seasons. The ECHAM- HAM model includes inactive SOA following the prescribed emissions in (56), while SPRINTARS calculates the oxidation of precursors (terpene and isoprene) at a prescribed emission level over land according to the Global Emissions Initiative dataset. With default configurations, the differences in modeled SSA and direct radiative effects between two models are likely associated with the very different particle size distribution and refractive index, the two factors that affect SSA the most in the AeroCom models (text S1). Accordingly, we modify the modeled particle size and BC refractive index in the two models. In addition, emission and lifetime are corrected on the basis of our constrained results (table S3).

For ECHAM-HAM, we increase the emitted/ambient particle size by referring to our previous study (31). In SPRINTARS, we switch off the hygroscopic growth for OA which is likely too strong (57). Modifications to both models produce better agreement with the AE observations from POLDER-GRASP (fig. S22A). The AE bias in the default simulations and the corresponding improvement through corrections are further supported by AERONET observations (fig. S22B).\n2) Refractive index for BC. According to field measurements (58, 59), the imaginary part of refractive index of BC in the two models is changed to  $0.3i$ . Note that this value is lower than those used in the AeroCom models (0.44 to 0.79 for the imaginary part; see table S1). We conduct a sensitivity test on the imaginary part ranging from 0.1 to 0.5 with the corrected ECHAM-HAM model and find that the modified particle size with a value of 0.3 agrees the best with SSA observations from (24), suggesting that the observation-based refractive index is more suitable than those used in the AeroCom models (see fig. S23). In addition to SSA, this correction also results in better agreement with our constrained MAC for the two models (fig. S24). This refractive index is also used in a previous model study (60). Moreover, we also test different real parts of refractive index by changing values from 1.4 to 1.95 encompassing both observed values (61) and model-recommended values (see table S1). The resulting changes in AAOD are negligible  $(< 1\\%)$  and we maintain the default model values.\n3) Precipitation. A scaling factor is directly added to the modeled wet deposition based on the default precipitation error. This will correct the lifetime together with the modified particle size as stated above.\n4) Emissions.

Any two ST series in a pattern should 1) have correlated temporal trends during the time period of the pattern, and 2) have close geographic positions because a meaningful correlation tends to exist between the ST series close in space. Yet, the temporal trends and spatial context are heterogeneous with different scales and semantics. Fusing them to capture the spatiotemporal relation is non- trivial, let alone to mine the patterns where multiple ST series should have many such relations with each other."

The traditional Storyline can neither display the fine- grained temporal trends nor provide the spatial context for ST series analyses. Previous studies [17, 62] attempted to extend Storyline techniques to spatiotemporal scenarios but cannot accommodate large- scale datasets with many locations and long time ranges. The Storyline occupies the most effective visual channel (i.e., position) and is compact in layout. Thus, popular temporal visualizations (e.g., line charts) and spatial visualizations (e.g., a map) are difficult to integrate."

The ST series of the same cluster can be visually summarized by a representative one because they are similar [74]. Yet, existing methods treated spatial and temporal dimensions separately [60] and thus cannot capture the spatiotemporal relationship that shifts in both time and space. Besides, considering the whole time span may ignore local features. To this end, the sliding window strategy is helpful [1, 40]. A window slides along time, and its size is far less than the series' length. Clustering is performed on the parts of time series covered by the window."

We denote the subpart of an ST series in a line chart as a sub- ST series. For a line chart, we respectively normalize each sub- ST series there according to its max and min values. For each time stamp in the line chart, we have a set of values, each of which is from a normalized sub- ST series. Afterward, we obtain the lower quartile  $q_{n}(0.25)$ , median, and upper quartile  $q_{n}(0.75)$  for these values. Finally, the lower and upper quartiles in all time stamps are visualized with an area. The medians in all time stamps form a median line. The line is superimposed with the area, constituting a trend motif. Via the trend motif, the correlative trends of multiple ST series can be revealed in circumstances where the ST series are dissimilar in values from each other. For example, the trend motif of Fig. 6F clearly shows an upward trend of the ST series in Fig. 6E."

They separated into left and right regions (Fig. 1D4). Second, the black ST series were less correlated with others and the readings did not rise very high (Fig. 1E1).

Finally, the red ST series experienced a decrease on the third day, followed by an increase during the final three days, whereas the other ST series remained on a downward trend (Fig. 1E and F).

The above observations implied that there might be propagation processes of air pollution from north to south in the first two/three days. Afterwards, the air in both regions was filled with air pollutants. The fluctuation/decline trends in the orange and purple ST series were different since the industrial structure and pollution purification capabilities of the two regions were different.

However, the STC is plagued by well- known issues such as visual occlusion and depth ambiguity, which are further exacerbated when dealing with large- scale spatial time series data. In this study, we introduce a novel technical framework termed VolumeSTCube, designed for continuous spatiotemporal phenomena. It first leverages the concept of the STC to transform discretely distributed spatial time series data into continuously volumetric data. Subsequently, volume rendering and surface rendering techniques are employed to visualize the transformed volumetric data. Volume rendering is utilized to mitigate visual occlusion, while surface rendering provides pattern details by enhanced lighting information. Lastly, we design interactions to facilitate the exploration and analysis from temporal, spatial, and spatiotemporal perspectives. VolumeSTCube is evaluated through a computational experiment, a real- world case study with one expert, and a controlled user study with twelve non- experts, compared against a baseline from prior work, showing its superiority and effectiveness in large- scale spatial time series analysis."

      "paragraph_info": "The effective composition of spatial and temporal visualizations has long been the most challenging problem in the visualization of spatiotemporal data beyond ST series [4], [5]. Linked views require users to pay context- switching costs to browse the spatial and temporal visualizations separately. In contrast, an integrated view tightly organizes the spatial and temporal visualizations to reduce such costs. The spacetime cube (STC) [6] is a kind of integrated view in a three- dimensional space, in which the space naturally occupies two dimensions (i.e., x- y plane), and the time constitutes the third dimension (i.e., z- axis). The position of the visual graphics can be directly related to both space and time dimensions. It is easy for users to accept and learn, and thus, users can perceive time and space simultaneously [7]. Moreover, in the STC, the evolution of spatiotemporal phenomena can be effectively conveyed through temporal narratives, as geographic- related information is visualized along a continuous timeline [8]."

Yet, adopting the STC to visualize large- scale ST series is still in an exploratory stage. Prior studies [14]- [16] adopted the STC to visualize ST series (e.g., Figure 1), but only a few timestamps (e.g.,  $\\leq 30$  are applicable. It remains unexplored how to enable in- depth visual analysis of large- scale, highly dynamic, and multi- correlated ST series data based on the STC. To this end, this study aims to enhance the STC for visualizing large- scale ST series. However, two major challenges are posed."

However, the effective presentation of massive values is non- trivial. With Thakur and Hanson's method [14], the graphic plot of each ST series tends to occlude each other (Figure 1). Besides, the dataset's hidden spatiotemporal patterns (e.g., hotspots and propagation processes) cannot be revealed clearly. New data transformation and visualization strategies are strongly required to summarize and present the large- scale ST series in less visual occlusion."

The STC seamlessly integrates spatial and temporal dimensions within a 3D cube space, comprising a geographic map (i.e., a plane) and a vertical time axis. Such a design enables users to view the entire spatiotemporal dataset in a single view with both spatial context and temporal information concurrently. This sets it apart from 2D visualization techniques, which typically require users to navigate slider controls for temporal exploration or toggle between a geographic map and a separate time- oriented visualization."

The study primarily aimed to verify 1) the effectiveness of continuous volume- based visualization compared to column- based visualization and 2) the ease of understanding of volume- based visualization combined with the space- time cube. Besides, we hoped to identify the strengths and weaknesses of VolumeSTCube. While numerous methods, such as 2D map- based estimations or coordinated 2D maps and line charts, are available for comparison, these approaches differ fundamentally in design and interaction principles from STC- based methods. We selected Thakur and Hanson's STC- based method [14] as the baseline, shown in Figure 1. This method, the most recent STC- based visualization for ST series, lacks volumetric representation but serves as a representative of similar methods [15], [16]. Its design allows a focused evaluation of the benefits introduced by volume- based visualization."

The average response time for questions Q9 and Q10 was at least 7 seconds shorter when using VolumeSTCube than when using the baseline. For Q4 and Q9, the Wilcoxon test on the response times of using the two systems results in  $p = 0.03$  (significance) and  $p = 0.06$  (weak significance), respectively.

Furthermore, to improve the STC's adaptability to large-scale datasets, we design interactions for users to manipulate the STC from time and space dimensions, corresponding to spatial and temporal selection interactions common in 2D views. In the case study, the expert comprehensively analyzed an quality in China, demonstrating VolumeSTCube's effectiveness. The user study employed carefully designed tasks that required participants to utilize both volume and surface visualizations, alongside interactions such as volume spotlight, slicing, and voxel cluster-based techniques, to complete the analyses. The high accuracy and efficiency observed in task completion indicate that participants mastered VolumeSTCube, further underscoring its usability, effectiveness, and broad applicability."

However, the patterns and insights derived in these studies do not imply true causality, and thus the reliability of the results is often limited in applications. Recent studies [38, 89] have investigated applying the Granger causality test to capture the causal relations among urban time series. Based on a set of urban time series, these studies attempt to extract a causal graph, where each cause- effect relation between a pair of sensors is represented with a directed edge. However, one causal graph is insufficient to characterize the dynamic causal relations among multiple urban time series due to the rapidly- changing urban environments. For example, a causal relation between two sensors detected based on their time series can disappear or even be flipped from time to time (Fig. 2a) because of certain external factors, such as the wind fields in the air pollution scenarios. Such a dynamic nature demands fine- grained causality analyses that enable analysts to gain insights into the temporal variations of causal relations in urban contexts. In addition to the limitation of granularity in the prior studies, interpreting and validating these causal relations detected by automated models also require an interactive system to integrate analysts in the urban causality analysis loop [76]."

This framework includes neighbor index, time partition, and debounce strategies to improve the capability of the causality test for urban time series. For the second challenge, we design a dynamic graph visualization to reveal the temporal variation of the detected causal relations and enable time- oriented drill- down analyses of causal graphs. For the third challenge, we consider the multiple dimensions of causal relations and propose a tailored visualization to expose causality suspiciousness. Finally, two real- world case studies on air pollution and traffic speed datasets, respectively, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. In sum, our contributions are as follows:"

This view should satisfy two requirements, showing details and revealing suspiciousness. We have created two alternatives after exploring the design space. The first one is the spreadsheet that is commonly seen as a detail view (Fig. 7b- 1). However, it cannot handle many relations. The second one is the PCP (Fig. 7b- 2) better than the spreadsheet. Numerous causal relations can be displayed. The values of each dimension can be seen in the parallel axes. The first type of suspicious relations can be indicated by the gray lines passing the top of the distance axis (Fig. 7b- 2). Built on the PCP, we adopt scatterplots to visualize the dimensions related to the same causal direction (Fig. 6d). Scatterplots allow another suspiciousness metric, the Pearson's  $r$ , to be encoded using the size that can be accurately perceived.

      "paragraph_info": "In numerical model simulations, data assimilation (DA) on the initial conditions and bias correction (BC) of model outputs have been proven to be promising approaches to improving  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  (particulate matter with an aerodynamic equivalent diameter of  $\\leq 2.5\\mu \\mathrm{m}$ ) predictions. This study compared the optimization effects of these two methods and developed a new scheme that combines DA and BC simultaneously. Four parallel experiments were conducted during winter 2019: a control experiment directly forecasted by WRF- Chem (experiment name: WRF- Chem); an experiment that assimilated in situ observations based on the GSI (Gridpoint Statistical Interpolation) system (WRF- Chem_DA); an experiment with deep- learning- based BC (WRF- Chem_BC); and an experiment considering the combination of DA on the initial conditions and BC (WRF- Chem_DA_BC). Statistically, the accuracy of  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  predictions could be optimized by both DA and BC for the first 24- h period, and WRF- Chem_BC performed better than WRF- Chem_DA in the initial field, especially in the period of 10–24 h, while the best performance was achieved by combining BC and DA. Throughout the initial 24- h period, compared with the control experiment, the results of WRF- Chem_DA_BC (WRF- Chem_DA, WRF- Chem_BC) showed an improvement in terms of root- mean- square error, with reduction proportions varying from 38.90% to 48.86% (18.88% to 32.44%, 30.10% to 46.08%). Besides having the best optimization effect over the whole domain, the combined method also performed well in different regions: during the forecasting period of 0–24 h, the RMSEs decreased from 32% to 62%, 39% to 57%, 28% to 40%, and 30% to 49% in the Beijing- Tianjin- Hebei, Yangtze River Delta, Central China, and Sichuan Basin urban agglomerations, respectively."

(2012) used three different assimilation methods with MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) AOD (aerosol optical depth) products and in situ  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  observations, and the results showed that all three methods improved the forecasting of aerosols. Song et al. (2021) used the 3DVAR (three- dimensional variational) approach to jointly assimilate meteorological data and in situ observations to improve the prediction of  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$ . Hong et al. (2022) assimilated in situ observations and satellite data simultaneously to further improve  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  predictions. And in another study, different kinds of data were used in the assimilation of the initial field to analyze the enhancement of  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  forecasts by different assimilation sources (Ma et al., 2024). These previous studies have shown that DA can improve  $\\mathrm{PM}_{2.5}$  predictions by adjusting the initial state of the atmospheric chemistry, but the improvement of the prediction is limited, and the effect of assimilation gradually disappears with long- term integration of the simulation (Ma et al., 2024; Ma et al., 2020; Hong et al., 2022). In addition, the model prediction errors are not only affected by the uncertainty of the initial field, but also various other uncertainties such as those of the meteorological field and the physicochemical reactions (Zhu et al., 2018). Numerical model BC comprehensively considers the systematic errors of the model forecast to improve the forecast accuracy. Different from DA, which is the adjustment of the initial field from the model input perspective, BC is the post- processing of model outputs from the back end of the model, and can to a certain extent make up for the limitations of initial field DA."

      "paragraph_info": "BC is a statistical method that improves model predictions by establishing a relationship between historical observations and the corresponding model forecasts, from which the forecast bias can be extracted and the systematic errors corrected. With the advancements made in this line of research, BC methods have been developed from the earlier complete forecast method (Klein et al., 1959) to the model output statistical method (Glahn and Lowry, 1972), and then gradually evolved into different BC schemes. Frequency matching, Bayesian averaging, least- squares regression, multiple linear regression, and other statistical methods have been used to establish BC models, which significantly reduce systematic errors by learning the empirical relationships between historical forecasts and observations to realize BC (Raftery et al., 2005; Zhu and Luo, 2015; Xie et al., 2012; Chen et al., 2012; You, 2014). Recently, artificial- intelligence machine- learning techniques have emerged. Subsequently, BC based on machine- learning methods has been shown to better express the auxiliary links between various facets of the atmosphere, including, for instance, the different elements involved in atmospheric chemistry and key basic meteorological variables such as temperature and winds (Marzban, 2003; Zhang et al., 2022). Machine- learning models have been used in the BC of model outputs to improve  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  forecasts. For example, Ran et al. (2023) performed BC based on a multiple linear regression modeling approach to reduce the global  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  prediction bias; and Liu and Xing (2022a), Liu and Xing (2022b) designed a fully connected deep neural network to correct the  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  concentration bias in the outputs of chemical models, achieving better results than without the correction method applied. Ma et al. (2020) applied a time series model to correct  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  forecasts, which achieved good results. Different machine- learning methods were utilized by Li et al. (2021) as bias adjustment for postprocessing forecasts of  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  and  $\\mathrm{O}_3$ , showing the optimal approach to be the Random Forest model. Lu et al. (2020) utilized machine- learning methods to improve the accuracy of  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  forecasts through WRF- Chem in the Chengdu- Chongqing region. Overall, machine- learning methods have shown strong advantages in mining nonlinear relationships, enabling them to perform well in the BC of numerical predictions. However, they usually require massive, multi- source data inputs, which can limit their applicability in specific scenarios."

Actually, a multiscale convolution module was joined to connect and extract different scales of feature maps, and the depth- separable convolution can compress the feature mapping. MDS- UNet shows advantages in multiscale feature learning due to its multiscale convolution module, as compared with the traditional UNet. The single convolution kernel in the traditional model can only catch some of the features of the pollutants with a fixed scale. However, pollution characteristics vary on different spatial scales and multiscale convolution adopts a hierarchical structure with different spatial sizes of convolution kernels to extract the multiscale features by learning feature maps from the image. By merging feature maps of different scale, not only the pollutant concentration values, but also the spatial information on pollutant distributions, can then be obtained. The model has three advantages: acquisition of multiscale information, acquiring surrounding spatial information, and reducing information loss."

The different improvements on the predictions achieved through DA and BC were evaluated with different error indicators. Fig. 3 shows the spatial performances of  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  prediction RMSEs averaged in winter produced by the different experiments. The prediction RMSEs in the control experiment were larger than those in the other three experiments, with high values mainly in BTH, YRD, CC, and some southwestern regions, and the RMSE even reached  $100\\mu \\mathrm{g} / \\mathrm{m}^3$  in some northern areas. By comparing Fig. 3a, 3b and 3c, it can be seen that both DA and BC were able to reduce the  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  prediction RMSE, despite different performances over different regions. Compared with the control experiment, the prediction RMSE in WRF- Chem_DA was  $20 - 40\\mu \\mathrm{g} / \\mathrm{m}^3$  lower over CC and YRD, while the DA improvements were small over BTH, where large RMSE values could still be seen.

As can be seen, WRF- Chem overestimated the  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  concentrations over some areas of SCB, CC, and YRD, with the prediction MB values reaching  $60\\mu \\mathrm{g} / \\mathrm{m}^3$  in some areas. A reason for this might be that the emissions inventory overestimated the winter emissions in the above regions and the model simulation was relatively more uncertain due to the complex terrain (Wei et al., 2022). In contrast, the  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  concentrations were underestimated in BTH, with the prediction MB ranging from  $- 60$  to  $- 20\\mu \\mathrm{g} / \\mathrm{m}^3$ . This performance whereby WRF- Chem always underestimates  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  concentrations over northern areas in China is a common problem, caused by not simulating secondary aerosols or the transformation mechanisms with their gaseous precursors (Ma, 2020; Wei et al., 2022; Qin et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2016). The prediction MB values were reduced by the DA and BC methods, but BC had better effects in terms of prediction improvement. Consistent with the results shown in Fig. 3, despite the adjustment to the original overestimation by DA in WRF- Chem_DA over some regions of SCB and CC, the prediction MB values could still reach  $60\\mu \\mathrm{g} / \\mathrm{m}^3$  in some areas, thus demonstrating some advantages of DA, but with limitations. Compared with the direct predictions of WRF- Chem, the prediction MB values in the WRF- Chem_BC experiment were reduced over most areas due to BC effects. It is worth noting that the original overestimation changed to an underestimation in the WRF- Chem_BC experiment over some regions of YRD and the Shandong Peninsula, which indicated overcorrection by BC. For WRF- Chem_DA_BC, the prediction MB was the smallest among all the experiments, with values less than  $20\\mu \\mathrm{g} / \\mathrm{m}^3$  over most areas. WRF- Chem_DA_BC showed a smaller prediction MB than WRF- Chem_BC, especially over the Shandong Peninsula and YRD regions."

From the scatter fitting analysis results, WRF- Chem_DA_BC performed best in its consistency with observations following optimization. The results predicted directly by WRF- Chem in the control experiment were dispersed, with some isolated overestimation and underestimation scatter points fitted along the slope of 0.56, which demonstrates poor ability in simulating the high- pollution zones. By applying DA, the predictions of WRF- Chem_DA were partially improved, with an increased fitting slope of 0.69, showing less overestimation and underestimation through the adjustment of the initial field. The optimization of WRF- Chem_BC was much more evident than that of WRF- Chem_DA compared with the control experiment since the overestimation of the model was adjusted and the overall scatter distributions were more concentrated. However, there still existed an overall underestimation trend, with a slope of 0.73 after BC, which may not be sufficient for the simulation of strong pollution processes. It can be seen from Fig. 6a and 6d that the results of WRF- Chem_DA_BC were greatly improved by combining the two optimization methods, with the fitted slope of 1.04 being close to the straight line of  $k = 1$ . In this experiment, the  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  predictions were well adjusted and almost all of the high pollution could be captured, showing the best agreement with the observations.

It is evident that all three experiments were able to improve the  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  predictions in terms of their RMSEs compared with the control experiment. The variations of the RMSE values produced by WRF- Chem and WRF- Chem_DA were similar to those in the results of previous studies (Hong et al., 2022; Peng et al., 2018a; Peng et al., 2018b; Ma et al., 2024). Both BC and DA reduced the  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  prediction RMSEs throughout the entire 24- h forecasting period, with reductions of  $17.89 - 33.61\\mu \\mathrm{g} / \\mathrm{m}^3$  and  $13.27 - 21.82\\mu \\mathrm{g} / \\mathrm{m}^3$ , respectively. During the first  $0 - 10\\mathrm{h}$ , the optimization effects of DA and BC were similar, but then BC started to perform better during 10- 24 h due to the timeliness of the DA in the initial field, which has also been reported in previous research (Jiang et al., 2013; Ma et al., 2024). Since the optimization of BC was not sensitive to time, the improvement effects could then be maintained, with a normalized RMSE of 0.54 to 0.70, during the 0- 24- h forecasting period. Comparatively, WRF- Chem_DA_BC produced more accurate  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  predictions than WRF- Chem_DA and WRF- Chem_BC during the first 24- h period, with an RMSE reduction of 23.52 to  $35.95\\mu \\mathrm{g} / \\mathrm{m}^3$  owing to the adjustment of the initial field for the model input and the correction of the output at the same time to achieve a double optimization. Overall, despite the positive effects on  $\\mathrm{PM}_{2.5}$  predictions, the optimization achieved by the different experiments varied; specifically, WRF- Chem_DA_BC was best, followed by WRF- Chem_BC, and then finally WRF- Chem_DA. The error values of predictions produced by WRF- Chem and WRF- Chem_DA were close to some previous DA results in China (Peng et al., 2018a; Peng et al., 2018b; Ma et al., 2024)."

The improvement of  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  predictions in BTH in terms of RMSE reductions by BC were more obvious than those by DA, with regional- average normalized RMSEs of 0.78- 0.87 and 0.41- 0.72, respectively, which was consistent with the RMSE and MB distributions. From the perspective of the regional- average RMSE, WRF- Chem_DA_BC produced a reduction in values of  $24.74 - 78.25\\mu \\mathrm{g} / \\mathrm{m}^3$  due to the combination of DA and BC effects, which shows its advantages over the other experiments in the BTH region. Both DA and BC were able to make adjustments to the overestimation of the  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  predictions in the control experiment in YRD and CC. However, despite their similar effects in the first  $10\\mathrm{h}$ , the optimization of BC was much better than DA in the later forecasting period since the effects of DA may decrease with the increase in the forecasting period. In SCB, the optimization of DA was not as good as that in CC and YRD due to the larger uncertainty caused by the complex terrain here (Wei et al., 2022), which caused the relatively similar effects of the WRF- Chem_BC and WRF- Chem_DA_BC experiments here. Overall, the effects of DA over YRD and CC were more obvious than over BTH and SCB. BC led to good performances over the whole 0- 24- h forecasting period, while DA effects may diminish with the increase in forecasting hours. By combining DA and BC in the WRF- Chem_DA_BC experiment, the consistency between  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  predictions and observations was improved greatly, showing the best forecast effects. The normalized RMSEs produced by WRF- Chem_DA_BC over BTH, YRD, CC, and SCB were 0.38- 0.68, 0.43- 0.61, 0.60- 0.72, and 0.51- 0.70, respectively.

Assessments of these impacts rely heavily on the modeled aerosol absorption from poorly constrained global models and thus exhibit large uncertainties. By combining the AeroCom model ensemble with satellite and in situ observations, we provide constraints on the aerosol absorption optical depth (AAOD) over the Amazon and Africa. Our approach enables identification of error contributions from emission, lifetime, and MAC (mass absorption coefficient) per model, with MAC and emission dominating the AAOD errors over Amazon and Africa, respectively. In addition to primary emissions, our analysis suggests substantial formation of secondary organic aerosols over the Amazon but not over Africa. Furthermore, we find that differences in direct aerosol radiative effects between models decrease by threefold over the BB source and outflow regions after correcting the identified errors. This highlights the potential to greatly reduce the uncertainty in the most uncertain radiative forcing agent."

      "paragraph_info": "Despite the recent progress in airborne measurements of BBA, large- scale and long- term assessments of the climate impacts of BBA have far relied on global aerosol models (14, 15). However, models have shown substantial discrepancies and errors regarding BBA absorption (16- 19), which remains a key obstacle to reliable climate assessments because BBA absorption can simultaneously contribute to direct, semidirect, and indirect aerosol effects (9, 20). Comparisons between models and satellite observations suggest that global models generally underestimate the overall warming impacts of BBA, as indicated by a substantial underestimation of the aerosol absorption optical depth (AAOD) (21) in combination with an overestimation of the single- scattering albedo (SSA) (20). These findings are supported by flight campaign measurements (22, 23) such as the ObseRvations of Aerosols above CLOUDs and their intEractionS (ORACLES) project (22), suggesting that the overall warming caused by BBA plumes is greater than previously considered, particularly in tropical regions. However, when considering the aerosol composition, global models tend to produce stronger absorption than observed from field and laboratory measurements for a given BC mass mixing ratio (24). The contradiction between the underestimated overall warming and overestimated absorbing capability per unit of BC mass highlights important errors in the emission, composition, and optical properties of absorbing BBA. Although there have been discussions regarding the possible reasons for these model errors [e.g., particle size distribution, vertical profiles, mixing states, and refractive index (24- 28)], a quantitative evaluation of how these factors contribute to the overall errors is still missing. This poses a fundamental challenge to the aerosol modeling community, which hinders reliable climate assessments over tropical regions."

It is similar to the methodology applied in a previous study (31), in which we analyze AOD and considered all aerosols instead of carbonaceous aerosols only. Briefly, we linearly regressed modeled MAC against modeled SSA and modeled  $\\tau$  against modeled precipitation and the angstrom exponent (AE; an indicator of ambient particle size) using the model data from the AeroCom (Aerosol Comparisons between Observations and Models; see table S1) project. Then, we applied satellite observations of SSA to estimate the constrained MAC and similarly constrain  $\\tau$  from observations of precipitation and AE. Last, we used Eq. 1 to constrain  $E$  The constrained values of  $E,\\tau ,$  and MAC allow us to attribute AAOD errors to contributions from these three factors for individual models. Uncertainty analysis is conducted for all these constraining processes as shown in Fig. 1. Notably, the constrained results are only effective on a regional and seasonal scale, and caution must be exercised when directly applying these results to smaller scales. This work presents advancements upon the foundation of (31) as it constrains MAC instead of MEC (mass extinction coefficient). In addition, we implement in situ data in the interpretation of satellite observations that allows a disaggregation of BC and OC emissions. Furthermore, in our seasonal, regional analysis, we find that SOA formation is important for fire aerosols over the Amazon but not over Africa."

We find that most inventories estimate lower emissions than our estimates over Africa, which partly explains the negative AAOD bias (Fig. 3B), as these inventories are used in AeroCom models (table S1)."

The discrepancy is also affected by the variation in emission factor (EF), but it is unlikely to fully explain the low emissions, as the EFs used in the inventories generally agree with field measurements (see table S2 and fig. S8). In the Amazon, the inventories also estimate lower OA emission levels relative to our constrained OA. However, the BC inventory emissions are generally higher (except in the GFAS inventory), which is consistent with the overestimated MAC in models (Fig. 3A). Again, this cannot be explained by uncertainties in the EFs (fig. S8), which implies that the low OA emissions in the inventories over the Amazon result from missing sources."

S17). The raw POLDER- GRASP data are then applied to the regression to estimate the regional AAOD. A similar method is also used to estimate the regional SSA. The robustness of the method is verified through a jackknife test by removing the models one by one, which produces small relative variations in the predicted regional AAOD and SSA (<1%), suggesting that the construction of regional values is independent of the models used. The regional observations of AAOD and SSA are also used to validate the models on a seasonal scale (see fig. S18), showing a varying degree of error per model. Broadly, models tend to underestimate SSA over the Amazon (by 0.05 on average) and underestimate AAOD over Southern Africa (by 32% on average)."

All the variables are calculated as regional fire- season averages. Other absorbing components (e.g., dust) are assumed to have negligible impacts given the small contribution indicated by the observations (50) and AeroCom models (4%) for the two regions. In addition, we find a small absorption AE from POLDER- GRASP observations (fig. S19), suggesting that brown carbon is not important (51, 52).

For the AeroCom models, we compare the SSA for total aerosols and the SSA of grid cells with  $\\geq 85\\%$  carbonaceous aerosol components, with small differences being found for most models, especially within the range of the SSA observations (see fig.

For the first challenge, GeoChron includes a carefully- designed data mining framework. The framework slices the time span and captures reliable correlation relations between ST series in each time slice. Afterward, it employs a network formulation to fuse the correlation relations above and the spatial proximity in a semantic- preserving way and detect communities as evolution patterns. Consequently, the Storyline layout algorithm can be applied by considering each ST series as an entity and considering an evolution pattern as a session. For the second challenge, GeoChron supports a novel two- level visualization mechanism to present the spatiotemporal information of large- scale ST series. At the first level, we revise the Storyline with new interactions and visual encodings, and link it with a geographic map, to present evolution patterns from a high level of perspective. At the second level, we employ an EvoLens, a lens placed on the Storyline, to display more details regarding the temporal trends of evolution patterns in a narrative- preserving manner. The map is coordinated with the EvoLens to provide the detailed spatial context of evolution patterns. GeoChron is comprehensively evaluated by a series of studies and analyses. In sum, our contributions are as follows:"

Fig. 9A shows a snapshot of the result. The nearly vertical curves bounce up and down on the screen, resulting in visual distractions. Moreover, some aligned sessions are meant to be visually continuous, but this continuity is broken by these curves (e.g., Fig. 9B). Smaller the  $th_w$ , the less clutter. Second, we directly use the correlation coefficients in time slices rather than sliding windows and generate the layout in Fig. 9C with the same parameters in the first case ( $th_s = 7$  and  $th_c = 3$ ). We remove the gradient shade and focus on the layout. Compared with the time window- based results in Fig. 5D, the correlation relationship between ST series is more dynamic. In particular, the dashed ellipses in Fig. 9D and E highlight the unexpected deviation of curves. Entities part suddenly and come back together again, which may be due to the slightly offset time slices, subtle pollution events, or errors. Such deviations lead to visual clusters and prevent users from locating prominent visual patterns. It can be concluded that the sliding window does improve the readability of representations."

The layout is high when these two parameters are small (e.g., Fig. 10F). Users may have difficulty browsing the visualization. Increasing the two parameters can compact the layout. They work by different principles. On the one hand, in creasing  $th_c$  results in the layout with looser alignment (e.g., Fig. 10G). Users can still analyze those sessions with small sizes. On the other hand, increasing  $th_s$  results in the layout of Fig. 5A or D, where fewer sessions are displayed (Fig. 10B)."

In the future, we plan to implement a rendering parameter adjustment control to alleviate this problem. For example, the mapping of values to transparency and color can be adjusted interactively. Finally, most subjects expressed that surface rendering offered clear boundaries for voxel clusters, aiding in obtaining specific values at spatiotemporal positions and assessing propagation processes. This capability could be difficult to achieve solely with volume rendering. Interestingly, some subjects with strong spatial perception felt relying solely on volume visualization was sufficient."

Furthermore, to improve the STC's adaptability to large-scale datasets, we design interactions for users to manipulate the STC from time and space dimensions, corresponding to spatial and temporal selection interactions common in 2D views. In the case study, the expert comprehensively analyzed an quality in China, demonstrating VolumeSTCube's effectiveness. The user study employed carefully designed tasks that required participants to utilize both volume and surface visualizations, alongside interactions such as volume spotlight, slicing, and voxel cluster-based techniques, to complete the analyses.

      "paragraph_info": "Abstract— The spatial time series generated by city sensors allow us to observe urban phenomena like environmental pollution and traffic congestion at an unprecedented scale. However, recovering causal relations from these observations to explain the sources of urban phenomena remains a challenging task because these causal relations tend to be time- varying and demand proper time series partitioning for effective analyses. The prior approaches extract one causal graph given long- time observations, which cannot be directly applied to capturing, interpreting, and validating dynamic urban causality. This paper presents Compass, a novel visual analytics approach for in- depth analyses of the dynamic causality in urban time series. To develop Compass, we identify and address three challenges: detecting urban causality, interpreting dynamic causal relations, and unveiling suspicious causal relations. First, multiple causal graphs over time among urban time series are obtained with a causal detection framework extended from the Granger causality test. Then, a dynamic causal graph visualization is designed to reveal the time- varying causal relations across these causal graphs and facilitate the exploration of the graphs along the time. Finally, a tailored multi- dimensional visualization is developed to support the identification of spurious causal relations, thereby improving the reliability of causal analyses. The effectiveness of Compass is evaluated with two case studies conducted on the real- world urban datasets, including the air pollution and traffic speed datasets, and positive feedback was received from domain experts."

      "paragraph_info": "BC is a statistical method that improves model predictions by establishing a relationship between historical observations and the corresponding model forecasts, from which the forecast bias can be extracted and the systematic errors corrected. With the advancements made in this line of research, BC methods have been developed from the earlier complete forecast method (Klein et al., 1959) to the model output statistical method (Glahn and Lowry, 1972), and then gradually evolved into different BC schemes. Frequency matching, Bayesian averaging, least- squares regression, multiple linear regression, and other statistical methods have been used to establish BC models, which significantly reduce systematic errors by learning the empirical relationships between historical forecasts and observations to realize BC (Raftery et al., 2005; Zhu and Luo, 2015; Xie et al., 2012; Chen et al., 2012; You, 2014). Recently, artificial- intelligence machine- learning techniques have emerged. Subsequently, BC based on machine- learning methods has been shown to better express the auxiliary links between various facets of the atmosphere, including, for instance, the different elements involved in atmospheric chemistry and key basic meteorological variables such as temperature and winds (Marzban, 2003; Zhang et al., 2022). Machine- learning models have been used in the BC of model outputs to improve  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  forecasts. For example, Ran et al. (2023) performed BC based on a multiple linear regression modeling approach to reduce the global  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  prediction bias; and Liu and Xing (2022a), Liu and Xing (2022b) designed a fully connected deep neural network to correct the  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  concentration bias in the outputs of chemical models, achieving better results than without the correction method applied. Ma et al. (2020) applied a time series model to correct  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  forecasts, which achieved good results. Different machine- learning methods were utilized by Li et al. (2021) as bias adjustment for postprocessing forecasts of  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  and  $\\mathrm{O}_3$ , showing the optimal approach to be the Random Forest model. Lu et al. (2020) utilized machine- learning methods to improve the accuracy of  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  forecasts through WRF- Chem in the Chengdu- Chongqing region. Overall, machine- learning methods have shown strong advantages in mining nonlinear relationships, enabling them to perform well in the BC of numerical predictions. However, they usually require massive, multi- source data inputs, which can limit their applicability in specific scenarios."

GSI 3DVAR is almost the same as traditional 3D variational methods, which are based on the idea of variational DA. However, it shows advantages in its ability to deal with observations that have complex nonlinear relationships with atmospheric state model variables, thus making it possible to assimilate observations with nonlinear relations to atmospheric state quantities. In order to improve aerosol predictions, an aerosol assimilation module was integrated systematically into the GSI 3DVAR system (Pagowski et al., 2014). In this paper, the DA of the initial field is based on the GSI system at 00:00 UTC each day. The GSI system is fitted to the observation and model background field by minimizing the objective function, and the analytical field is the optimal solution for the minimal value of the objective function in equation (1)."

Fig. 3 shows the spatial performances of  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  prediction RMSEs averaged in winter produced by the different experiments.

By comparing Fig. 3a, 3b and 3c, it can be seen that both DA and BC were able to reduce the  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  prediction RMSE, despite different performances over different regions. Compared with the control experiment, the prediction RMSE in WRF- Chem_DA was  $20 - 40\\mu \\mathrm{g} / \\mathrm{m}^3$  lower over CC and YRD, while the DA improvements were small over BTH, where large RMSE values could still be seen. In contrast, the performances of BC were much better than those of DA, showing RMSE reductions over most areas in China, and the RMSE values were less than  $80\\mu \\mathrm{g} / \\mathrm{m}^3$  in the WRF- Chem_BC experiment.

A reason for this might be that the emissions inventory overestimated the winter emissions in the above regions and the model simulation was relatively more uncertain due to the complex terrain (Wei et al., 2022). In contrast, the  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  concentrations were underestimated in BTH, with the prediction MB ranging from  $- 60$  to  $- 20\\mu \\mathrm{g} / \\mathrm{m}^3$ . This performance whereby WRF- Chem always underestimates  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  concentrations over northern areas in China is a common problem, caused by not simulating secondary aerosols or the transformation mechanisms with their gaseous precursors (Ma, 2020; Wei et al., 2022; Qin et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2016). The prediction MB values were reduced by the DA and BC methods, but BC had better effects in terms of prediction improvement. Consistent with the results shown in Fig. 3, despite the adjustment to the original overestimation by DA in WRF- Chem_DA over some regions of SCB and CC, the prediction MB values could still reach  $60\\mu \\mathrm{g} / \\mathrm{m}^3$  in some areas, thus demonstrating some advantages of DA, but with limitations. Compared with the direct predictions of WRF- Chem, the prediction MB values in the WRF- Chem_BC experiment were reduced over most areas due to BC effects. It is worth noting that the original overestimation changed to an underestimation in the WRF- Chem_BC experiment over some regions of YRD and the Shandong Peninsula, which indicated overcorrection by BC. For WRF- Chem_DA_BC, the prediction MB was the smallest among all the experiments, with values less than  $20\\mu \\mathrm{g} / \\mathrm{m}^3$  over most areas. WRF- Chem_DA_BC showed a smaller prediction MB than WRF- Chem_BC, especially over the Shandong Peninsula and YRD regions."

From the scatter fitting analysis results, WRF- Chem_DA_BC performed best in its consistency with observations following optimization. The results predicted directly by WRF- Chem in the control experiment were dispersed, with some isolated overestimation and underestimation scatter points fitted along the slope of 0.56, which demonstrates poor ability in simulating the high- pollution zones. By applying DA, the predictions of WRF- Chem_DA were partially improved, with an increased fitting slope of 0.69, showing less overestimation and underestimation through the adjustment of the initial field. The optimization of WRF- Chem_BC was much more evident than that of WRF- Chem_DA compared with the control experiment since the overestimation of the model was adjusted and the overall scatter distributions were more concentrated. However, there still existed an overall underestimation trend, with a slope of 0.73 after BC, which may not be sufficient for the simulation of strong pollution processes. It can be seen from Fig. 6a and 6d that the results of WRF- Chem_DA_BC were greatly improved by combining the two optimization methods, with the fitted slope of 1.04 being close to the straight line of  $k = 1$ . In this experiment, the  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  predictions were well adjusted and almost all of the high pollution could be captured, showing the best agreement with the observations. Overall, through adjustment of the model input field and correction of the model output, the predictions were effectively improved. It should be noted that the slope values in the control experiment and WRF- Chem_DA are close to those of previous results (Feng et al., 2018; Ma et al., 2024)."

It is evident that all three experiments were able to improve the  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  predictions in terms of their RMSEs compared with the control experiment. The variations of the RMSE values produced by WRF- Chem and WRF- Chem_DA were similar to those in the results of previous studies (Hong et al., 2022; Peng et al., 2018a; Peng et al., 2018b; Ma et al., 2024). Both BC and DA reduced the  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  prediction RMSEs throughout the entire 24- h forecasting period, with reductions of  $17.89 - 33.61\\mu \\mathrm{g} / \\mathrm{m}^3$  and  $13.27 - 21.82\\mu \\mathrm{g} / \\mathrm{m}^3$ , respectively. During the first  $0 - 10\\mathrm{h}$ , the optimization effects of DA and BC were similar, but then BC started to perform better during 10- 24 h due to the timeliness of the DA in the initial field, which has also been reported in previous research (Jiang et al., 2013; Ma et al., 2024). Since the optimization of BC was not sensitive to time, the improvement effects could then be maintained, with a normalized RMSE of 0.54 to 0.70, during the 0- 24- h forecasting period. Comparatively, WRF- Chem_DA_BC produced more accurate  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  predictions than WRF- Chem_DA and WRF- Chem_BC during the first 24- h period, with an RMSE reduction of 23.52 to  $35.95\\mu \\mathrm{g} / \\mathrm{m}^3$  owing to the adjustment of the initial field for the model input and the correction of the output at the same time to achieve a double optimization. Overall, despite the positive effects on  $\\mathrm{PM}_{2.5}$  predictions, the optimization achieved by the different experiments varied; specifically, WRF- Chem_DA_BC was best, followed by WRF- Chem_BC, and then finally WRF- Chem_DA. The error values of predictions produced by WRF- Chem and WRF- Chem_DA were close to some previous DA results in China (Peng et al., 2018a; Peng et al., 2018b; Ma et al., 2024)."

      "paragraph_info": "Biomass burning (BB) is a leading contributor to global emissions of carbonaceous aerosols that can potentially exacerbate climate warming by absorbing solar radiation at visible to ultraviolet (UV) wavelengths [i.e., black carbon (BC) and organic aerosol (OA), the absorbing component of OA is also referred to as brown carbon] (1, 2). Therefore, these absorbing BB aerosols (BBAs) can essentially affect radiation balance (2, 3), cloud formation and properties (4, 5), precipitation (6, 7), and regional circulation patterns (8, 9). To better understand these impacts, recent flight campaigns have paid particular attention to the BBA over tropical regions where large amounts of BBA are injected into the atmosphere every year (10- 13)."

      "paragraph_info": "The overall procedure for constraining the above three components is somewhat similar to strategies commonly used in the context of \"emergent constraints,\" but we have introduced a closure relation (based on a simple box model) that allows estimating three components from two modeled relationships. It is similar to the methodology applied in a previous study (31), in which we analyze AOD and considered all aerosols instead of carbonaceous aerosols only. Briefly, we linearly regressed modeled MAC against modeled SSA and modeled  $\\tau$  against modeled precipitation and the angstrom exponent (AE; an indicator of ambient particle size) using the model data from the AeroCom (Aerosol Comparisons between Observations and Models; see table S1) project. Then, we applied satellite observations of SSA to estimate the constrained MAC and similarly constrain  $\\tau$  from observations of precipitation and AE. Last, we used Eq. 1 to constrain  $E$  The constrained values of  $E,\\tau ,$  and MAC allow us to attribute AAOD errors to contributions from these three factors for individual models. Uncertainty analysis is conducted for all these constraining processes as shown in Fig. 1. Notably, the constrained results are only effective on a regional and seasonal scale, and caution must be exercised when directly applying these results to smaller scales. This work presents advancements upon the foundation of (31) as it constrains MAC instead of MEC (mass extinction coefficient). In addition, we implement in situ data in the interpretation of satellite observations that allows a disaggregation of BC and OC emissions. Furthermore, in our seasonal, regional analysis, we find that SOA formation is important for fire aerosols over the Amazon but not over Africa."

Such a linear relationship compares favorably with in situ and laboratory observations (Fig. 2) (24). The relationship is also confirmed by Mie calculations with varying configurations (e.g., mixing state, refractive index, and particle size; fig. S2). This suggests that the modeled relationship between MAC and SSA in AeroCom is robust. We then combine satellite observation of SSA with the linear relationship to constrain the MAC."

To characterize satellite errors, we consider three datasets: the Polarization and Directionality of the Earth's Reflectances with the Generalized Retrieval of Aerosol and Surface Properties (POLDER- GRASP) algorithm, the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) with UV aerosol algorithm (OMAERUV), and the Advanced Along- Track Scanning Radiometer with Optimal Retrieval of Aerosol and Cloud algorithm (AATSR- ORAC). We validate the three datasets against AERONET data (the locations of the AERONET sites used in this study are shown in fig. S1) following the procedure in (47) and find that POLDER- GRASP exhibits the lowest error and has the highest correlations with AERONET data for both AAOD and SSA (fig. S16). Therefore, we use POLDER- GRASP as the satellite observation (including AE) during 2010 fire seasons throughout the analysis. However, even for POLDER- GRASP, large retrieval errors exist, which contribute substantially to the overall uncertainties presented in this work."

      "paragraph_info": "To apply Eq. 1 in our analysis, a regional estimation of AAOD is required, which cannot be obtained directly from the sparsely sampled raw satellite data. Following the homogenization method in our previous work (31), we perform a linear regression between the modeled regional AAOD and modeled AAOD with POLDER- GRASP sampling (averaged over the region and fire season; fig. S17). The raw POLDER- GRASP data are then applied to the regression to estimate the regional AAOD. A similar method is also used to estimate the regional SSA. The robustness of the method is verified through a jackknife test by removing the models one by one, which produces small relative variations in the predicted regional AAOD and SSA (<1%), suggesting that the construction of regional values is independent of the models used. The regional observations of AAOD and SSA are also used to validate the models on a seasonal scale (see fig. S18), showing a varying degree of error per model. Broadly, models tend to underestimate SSA over the Amazon (by 0.05 on average) and underestimate AAOD over Southern Africa (by 32% on average)."

The emission is calculated as the total of the BC and OA emissions; lifetime is calculated as the (burden of  $\\mathrm{BC + OA}$ )/emission of  $\\mathrm{BC + OA}$ , and MAC is AAOD/(burden of  $\\mathrm{BC + OA}$ ). All the variables are calculated as regional fire- season averages. Other absorbing components (e.g., dust) are assumed to have negligible impacts given the small contribution indicated by the observations (50) and AeroCom models (4%) for the two regions. In addition, we find a small absorption AE from POLDER- GRASP observations (fig. S19), suggesting that brown carbon is not important (51, 52). Note that the emission in Eq. 1 includes both primary emissions and those from secondary formation (SOA), as the latter happens on a much smaller time scale than the seasonal average that we are working with."

Here, we do not use the modeled relationship between rBC and SSA, as we find that it contains a large error (see fig. S6). It should be noted that the relationship by (24) was established under the criteria that OA and BC accounted for more than  $85\\%$  of the total aerosol mass (to focus on BBAs). For the AeroCom models, we compare the SSA for total aerosols and the SSA of grid cells with  $\\geq 85\\%$  carbonaceous aerosol components, with small differences being found for most models, especially within the range of the SSA observations (see fig. S20A). This suggests that the SSA for total aerosols during fire seasons could sufficiently represent the aerosol criteria by (24), which allows us to constrain the rBC in the ambient aerosols from SSA on the basis of the observed relationship. Using another regression to link the rBC from ambient aerosols to the emissions (see fig. S20B), we lastly obtain the constrained rBC in emissions and estimate the separate emissions for BC and OA."

The detailed corrections are listed below for MAC (1 and 2), lifetime (1 and 3), and emission (4)."

      "paragraph_info": "Abstract- In geo- related fields such as urban informatics, atmospheric science, and geography, large- scale spatial time (ST) series (i.e., geo- referred time series) are collected for monitoring and understanding important spatiotemporal phenomena. ST series visualization is an effective means of understanding the data and reviewing spatiotemporal phenomena, which is a prerequisite for in- depth data analysis. However, visualizing these series is challenging due to their large scales, inherent dynamics, and spatiotemporal nature. In this study, we introduce the notion of patterns of evolution in ST series. Each evolution pattern is characterized by 1) a set of ST series that are close in space and 2) a time period when the trends of these ST series are correlated. We then leverage Storyline techniques by considering an analogy between evolution patterns and sessions, and finally design a novel visualization called GeoChron, which is capable of visualizing large- scale ST series in an evolution pattern- aware and narrative- preserving manner. GeoChron includes a mining framework to extract evolution patterns and two- level visualizations to enhance its visual scalability. We evaluate GeoChron with two case studies, an informal user study, an ablation study, parameter analysis, and running time analysis."

For the first challenge, GeoChron includes a carefully- designed data mining framework. The framework slices the time span and captures reliable correlation relations between ST series in each time slice. Afterward, it employs a network formulation to fuse the correlation relations above and the spatial proximity in a semantic- preserving way and detect communities as evolution patterns. Consequently, the Storyline layout algorithm can be applied by considering each ST series as an entity and considering an evolution pattern as a session. For the second challenge, GeoChron supports a novel two- level visualization mechanism to present the spatiotemporal information of large- scale ST series. At the first level, we revise the Storyline with new interactions and visual encodings, and link it with a geographic map, to present evolution patterns from a high level of perspective. At the second level, we employ an EvoLens, a lens placed on the Storyline, to display more details regarding the temporal trends of evolution patterns in a narrative- preserving manner. The map is coordinated with the EvoLens to provide the detailed spatial context of evolution patterns. GeoChron is comprehensively evaluated by a series of studies and analyses.

The frontend is implemented with TypeScript. It provides interactive visualizations for users. The Storyline is rendered on HTML5 canvas rather than HTML5 svg for efficiency."

      "paragraph_info": "We test the curve hiding and sliding windows via ablation studies following the first case. First, we set  $th_w = +Infinity$  to disable the curve hiding. Fig. 9A shows a snapshot of the result. The nearly vertical curves bounce up and down on the screen, resulting in visual distractions. Moreover, some aligned sessions are meant to be visually continuous, but this continuity is broken by these curves (e.g., Fig. 9B). Smaller the  $th_w$ , the less clutter. Second, we directly use the correlation coefficients in time slices rather than sliding windows and generate the layout in Fig. 9C with the same parameters in the first case ( $th_s = 7$  and  $th_c = 3$ ). We remove the gradient shade and focus on the layout. Compared with the time window- based results in Fig. 5D, the correlation relationship between ST series is more dynamic. In particular, the dashed ellipses in Fig. 9D and E highlight the unexpected deviation of curves. Entities part suddenly and come back together again, which may be due to the slightly offset time slices, subtle pollution events, or errors. Such deviations lead to visual clusters and prevent users from locating prominent visual patterns. It can be concluded that the sliding window does improve the readability of representations."

Taking the space- time volume in Figure 2B as an example, there is a  $3\\times 3$  grid (i.e.,  $m = n = 3$ ) in the geographic space and 3 timestamps (i.e.,  $T = 3$ ), resulting  $3\\times 3\\times 3$  samples or voxels in total.

Each cell is of uniform size and sufficiently small. For example, the geographic space in Figure 2A is divided into a  $3\\times 3$  grid with 9 cells. Second, we divide the ST series with  $T$  timestamps by their timestamps into  $T$  slices. For the  $t$ -th slice of the  $t$  timestamp,  $t\\leq T$ , there are observed data samples  $Z_{t} = {z_{1,t},z_{2,t},\\ldots ,z_{ST}}$ , with  $z_{i,t} = v_{i,t}$  representing the value of the  $i$ -th series at timestamp  $t$ . Afterwards, interpolation techniques, like Kriging and Inverse Distance Weighted, can be employed to predict  $\\hat{z}{c{x,y}}$  for each grid  $c_{x,y}\\in C$  based on observed data samples  $Z_{t}$ , generating a sample  $(s = (x,y),t,v = \\hat{z}{c{x,y}})$  in the spacetime volume. For each slice of each timestamp, we obtain a 2D scalar field with  $n\\times m$  cells. After performing the above operations for every slice, we stack the 2D scalar fields to form a completed space-time volume.\n2) Smoothing: Each generated 2D scalar field is smooth over the geographic space because of the spatial autocorrelation principle.

Assuming we are visualizing the ST series of air pollution concentration, below are some examples: If a voxel cluster extends significantly in the vertical direction and over the x- y plane, it indicates that the duration of poor air quality persists across a vast spatial area (Figure 3A①). If in a vertical cylindrical area in 3D cube space are voxel clusters with equal spacing, the air pollution exhibits periodicity at that location (Figure 3A②). If the voxel cluster exhibits shifts in 3D cube space, it indicates a process of air pollution propagation (Figure 3B and C)."

In the whole evaluation section, the geographic space is divided into a  $350 \\times 350$  grid. The time span is from January 1 to December 20, 2018, and the temporal granularity is one hour. In sum, the dataset comprises 448 (stations)  $\\times 8,472$  (timesteps) values, ranging from 0 to 500. Each value in the dataset is the AQI at the timestamp of a monitoring station. The higher the value, the worse the air quality. In the data transformation procedure, the parameters of the Gaussian model are automatically determined by the PyKridge library. We evaluated the accuracy of the adopted Kriging interpolation on the dataset and found it to be acceptable, ensuring the reliability of subsequent analyses.

Besides, we hoped to identify the strengths and weaknesses of VolumeSTCube. While numerous methods, such as 2D map- based estimations or coordinated 2D maps and line charts, are available for comparison, these approaches differ fundamentally in design and interaction principles from STC- based methods. We selected Thakur and Hanson's STC- based method [14] as the baseline, shown in Figure 1. This method, the most recent STC- based visualization for ST series, lacks volumetric representation but serves as a representative of similar methods [15], [16]. Its design allows a focused evaluation of the benefits introduced by volume- based visualization."

Andrienko and Andrienko [17] classified general and basic spatiotemporal analytical tasks into lookup, comparison, and relation- seeking at elementary and synoptic levels. We follow this well- established taxonomy to design concrete tasks, as Thakur and Hanson [14] did. We designed 18 tasks, as shown in Table I with the question form. These tasks cover the three kinds of tasks (i.e., lookup, comparison, and relation- seeking) at two levels (i.e., elementary and synoptic) proposed in Andrienko and Andrienko's taxonomy [17]. Elementary tasks deal with the elements of data, while synoptic tasks are performed on the spatiotemporal pattern rather than the elements. Considering our scenario and dataset, we define patterns as spatiotemporal hotspots and propagation processes. Moreover, we further refine the tasks from the spatial, temporal, and spatiotemporal perspectives, as indicated by the blue, pink, and green backgrounds, respectively. Since the subjects were not experts in air quality, the tasks only required them to describe the spatial, temporal, or spatiotemporal phenomena objectively and did not involve explaining the phenomena, such as how pollutants were generated."

However, recovering causal relations from these observations to explain the sources of urban phenomena remains a challenging task because these causal relations tend to be time- varying and demand proper time series partitioning for effective analyses. The prior approaches extract one causal graph given long- time observations, which cannot be directly applied to capturing, interpreting, and validating dynamic urban causality. This paper presents Compass, a novel visual analytics approach for in- depth analyses of the dynamic causality in urban time series. To develop Compass, we identify and address three challenges: detecting urban causality, interpreting dynamic causal relations, and unveiling suspicious causal relations. First, multiple causal graphs over time among urban time series are obtained with a causal detection framework extended from the Granger causality test. Then, a dynamic causal graph visualization is designed to reveal the time- varying causal relations across these causal graphs and facilitate the exploration of the graphs along the time. Finally, a tailored multi- dimensional visualization is developed to support the identification of spurious causal relations, thereby improving the reliability of causal analyses. The effectiveness of Compass is evaluated with two case studies conducted on the real- world urban datasets, including the air pollution and traffic speed datasets, and positive feedback was received from domain experts."

To develop Compass, we identify and address three challenges: detecting urban causality, interpreting dynamic causal relations, and unveiling suspicious causal relations. First, multiple causal graphs over time among urban time series are obtained with a causal detection framework extended from the Granger causality test. Then, a dynamic causal graph visualization is designed to reveal the time- varying causal relations across these causal graphs and facilitate the exploration of the graphs along the time. Finally, a tailored multi- dimensional visualization is developed to support the identification of spurious causal relations, thereby improving the reliability of causal analyses. The effectiveness of Compass is evaluated with two case studies conducted on the real- world urban datasets, including the air pollution and traffic speed datasets, and positive feedback was received from domain experts."

      "paragraph_info": "Many efforts have been devoted to the efficient extraction and extensive analysis of the co- occurrence [15, 36, 75] and correlation relations [45, 63] among urban time series or events. However, the patterns and insights derived in these studies do not imply true causality, and thus the reliability of the results is often limited in applications. Recent studies [38, 89] have investigated applying the Granger causality test to capture the causal relations among urban time series. Based on a set of urban time series, these studies attempt to extract a causal graph, where each cause- effect relation between a pair of sensors is represented with a directed edge. However, one causal graph is insufficient to characterize the dynamic causal relations among multiple urban time series due to the rapidly- changing urban environments. For example, a causal relation between two sensors detected based on their time series can disappear or even be flipped from time to time (Fig. 2a) because of certain external factors, such as the wind fields in the air pollution scenarios. Such a dynamic nature demands fine- grained causality analyses that enable analysts to gain insights into the temporal variations of causal relations in urban contexts. In addition to the limitation of granularity in the prior studies, interpreting and validating these causal relations detected by automated models also require an interactive system to integrate analysts in the urban causality analysis loop [76]."

In the past six months, we collaborated closely with three experts (EA, EB and EC). EA and EB are urban computing experts who have decades of experience studying data- driven solutions for urban problems. EC is a researcher with expertise in causal analyses.

The center sensor is denoted as an ego sensor  $s_e$ . The downstream and upstream sensors are denoted as  $Ego_d(s_e)$  and  $Ego_u(s_e)$ , respectively. Fig. 4a illustrates  $Ego_d(s_x)$  and Fig. 4b illustrates  $Ego_u(s_y)$ ."

A causal detection framework and temporal visualizations are combined to unveil these dynamic causalities. The case studies demonstrate the dynamic causalities in air pollution phenomena and traffic situations. The static causal graphs detected by the previous methods will ignore these time- varying cause- effect relationships and thus cannot support accurate and informed decisions. Second, we observe the causalities detected by automatic models are not always reliable in urban domains. This observation supports other researchers' opinion [31, 76] that human knowledge needs to be integrated into the analysis loop for reliable analyses."

Although ego graph- like causal graphs support an effective analysis for the target area, causal analyses can be enhanced with more complex causal graphs, such as by involving the relations between neighbor sensors. However, analyzing the complex graphs in a spatiotemporal context is challenging. For example, visual clutter is hard to avoid because the geo- fixed nodes make the causal graph layout methods inapplicable [65,76]. It also becomes difficult to clearly reveal the temporal variations of the detected causalities as the number of edges increases. Utilizing the third dimension can be a potential solution [5, 14, 62, 80] and deserves further study. Secondly, due to the lack of multi- source datasets in the same temporal and spatial scope, the effectiveness of our method in cross- domain causal analysis has not been proven. In fact, causality may exist between different urban datasets. For example, as the traffic volume increases, the air quality will deteriorate because cars emit exhaust gas and pollute the air [83]. In the future, we will collect richer datasets and conduct studies, thereby evaluating and improving our approaches. Finally, we found that when the number of links to be tested in all time windows is more than 150, the calculation time exceeds ten seconds. In the future, we will optimize the detection model, implement it with a more high- performance programming language, and deploy it to a distributed computing server."

Although both methods can improve the forecast accuracy of the model from the perspective of data statistics, previous studies have tended to analyze the enhancement of model forecasts by the two methods independently, with few studies having compared the enhancement effects of these two methods together. In addition, the effect of combining DA on the initial conditions and BC on the optimization of the model forecast has not been studied."

As such, greater optimization might be achievable by the additional assimilation of air quality data through applying an inverse method to retrieve an optimized emission inventory based on the model configuration as in the WRF- Chem_DA_BC experiment, which will be analyzed in future work."

The remarkable regional difference may be associated with the variation in precursor gas emissions from biogenic sources, with a notably higher level of such emissions found over the Amazon than over Africa (fig. S14). In comparison, model estimates of SOA production are very uncertain and usually fail to show regional differences between the Amazon and Africa. Our estimation, to our knowledge, is the first one in which SOA formation is constrained by aerosol absorption, which provides an innovative perspective on SOA estimation. The results also highlight the importance of SOA during fire seasons. This particular aspect has often been overlooked, and our findings emphasize the need for further research."

The latest version of ECHAM- HAM (ECHAM6.3.0- HAMMOZ2.3) is run at a T63 horizontal resolution  $(\\sim 1.875^{\\circ})$  and 47 vertical level (54). The SPRINTARS model presents simulations at the T213 horizontal grid  $(0.5625^{\\circ})$  with 40 vertical hybrid layers (55). Both simulations start in January 2010 with runs before the fire seasons as spin- up, and validations are made during the fire seasons. The ECHAM- HAM model includes inactive SOA following the prescribed emissions in (56), while SPRINTARS calculates the oxidation of precursors (terpene and isoprene) at a prescribed emission level over land according to the Global Emissions Initiative dataset.

ST series visualization is an effective means of understanding the data and reviewing spatiotemporal phenomena, which is a prerequisite for in- depth data analysis. However, visualizing these series is challenging due to their large scales, inherent dynamics, and spatiotemporal nature. In this study, we introduce the notion of patterns of evolution in ST series. Each evolution pattern is characterized by 1) a set of ST series that are close in space and 2) a time period when the trends of these ST series are correlated. We then leverage Storyline techniques by considering an analogy between evolution patterns and sessions, and finally design a novel visualization called GeoChron, which is capable of visualizing large- scale ST series in an evolution pattern- aware and narrative- preserving manner. GeoChron includes a mining framework to extract evolution patterns and two- level visualizations to enhance its visual scalability. We evaluate GeoChron with two case studies, an informal user study, an ablation study, parameter analysis, and running time analysis."

Then, users can specify a piecewise linear mapping function  $shade(\\nu)$  via the user interface of Fig. 5B.  $shade(\\nu)$  can map each value  $\\nu$  in a time series to a shade value between 0 and 1. 1 corresponds to the dark blue shade and 0 corresponds to the light blue shade. Subsequently, the shade value is used to generate a color that falls between the light and dark shades of blue. For example, given the mapping of Fig. 5B, higher values have colors with darker shades. For each curve  $C_{i}$ , we evenly sample a series of values from  $V_{i}$  and obtain the corresponding colors. We finally generate a gradient color stroke for  $C_{i}$  using these colors to reflect the trends of the time series."

According to participants' comments, the intuitiveness and ease of learning benefit from the proper use of existing good visualizations. The classic Storyline itself is easy to understand. The two- level visualizations built on it also have intuitive and simple encodings. In the first level, GeoChron uses the gradient shade and color to encode the temporal trends and geographic distribution, respectively. In the second level, GeoChron employs line charts to visualize the temporal trends in a familiar way."

Linked views require users to pay context- switching costs to browse the spatial and temporal visualizations separately. In contrast, an integrated view tightly organizes the spatial and temporal visualizations to reduce such costs. The spacetime cube (STC) [6] is a kind of integrated view in a three- dimensional space, in which the space naturally occupies two dimensions (i.e., x- y plane), and the time constitutes the third dimension (i.e., z- axis). The position of the visual graphics can be directly related to both space and time dimensions. It is easy for users to accept and learn, and thus, users can perceive time and space simultaneously [7]. Moreover, in the STC, the evolution of spatiotemporal phenomena can be effectively conveyed through temporal narratives, as geographic- related information is visualized along a continuous timeline [8]."

Yet, adopting the STC to visualize large- scale ST series is still in an exploratory stage. Prior studies [14]- [16] adopted the STC to visualize ST series (e.g., Figure 1), but only a few timestamps (e.g.,  $\\leq 30$  are applicable. It remains unexplored how to enable in- depth visual analysis of large- scale, highly dynamic, and multi- correlated ST series data based on the STC. To this end, this study aims to enhance the STC for visualizing large- scale ST series. However, two major challenges are posed."

However, a few interactions were designed to explore STC with large- scale spatiotemporal data. Filho et al. [39] introduced a set of interactions for selecting and filtering large- scale taxi trips in the STC from spatial and temporal perspectives. Our study aims to propose STC interactions for ST series of spatiotemporal phenomena.

Assuming we are visualizing the ST series of air pollution concentration, below are some examples: If a voxel cluster extends significantly in the vertical direction and over the x- y plane, it indicates that the duration of poor air quality persists across a vast spatial area (Figure 3A①). If in a vertical cylindrical area in 3D cube space are voxel clusters with equal spacing, the air pollution exhibits periodicity at that location (Figure 3A②). If the voxel cluster exhibits shifts in 3D cube space, it indicates a process of air pollution propagation (Figure 3B and C)."

Andrienko and Andrienko [17] classified general and basic spatiotemporal analytical tasks into lookup, comparison, and relation- seeking at elementary and synoptic levels. We follow this well- established taxonomy to design concrete tasks, as Thakur and Hanson [14] did. We designed 18 tasks, as shown in Table I with the question form. These tasks cover the three kinds of tasks (i.e., lookup, comparison, and relation- seeking) at two levels (i.e., elementary and synoptic) proposed in Andrienko and Andrienko's taxonomy [17]. Elementary tasks deal with the elements of data, while synoptic tasks are performed on the spatiotemporal pattern rather than the elements. Considering our scenario and dataset, we define patterns as spatiotemporal hotspots and propagation processes. Moreover, we further refine the tasks from the spatial, temporal, and spatiotemporal perspectives, as indicated by the blue, pink, and green backgrounds, respectively. Since the subjects were not experts in air quality, the tasks only required them to describe the spatial, temporal, or spatiotemporal phenomena objectively and did not involve explaining the phenomena, such as how pollutants were generated."

In the future, we plan to implement a rendering parameter adjustment control to alleviate this problem. For example, the mapping of values to transparency and color can be adjusted interactively. Finally, most subjects expressed that surface rendering offered clear boundaries for voxel clusters, aiding in obtaining specific values at spatiotemporal positions and assessing propagation processes. This capability could be difficult to achieve solely with volume rendering. Interestingly, some subjects with strong spatial perception felt relying solely on volume visualization was sufficient."

All subjects stated that the interactions regarding the spatial range and temporal range selections implemented in the two systems were helpful and effective in exploring large- scale spatiotemporal data. More interestingly, most subjects took it for granted that the voxel clusters in VolumeSTCube were clickable or could be selected. VolumeSTCube's voxel cluster- based interaction exactly offers such interactivity. Several subjects exactly commented, \"I prefer the voxel cluster- based interaction to locate hotspots in one step rather than the volume slicing first, followed by the volume spotlight and zooming- in.\""

      "paragraph_info": "Abstract— The spatial time series generated by city sensors allow us to observe urban phenomena like environmental pollution and traffic congestion at an unprecedented scale. However, recovering causal relations from these observations to explain the sources of urban phenomena remains a challenging task because these causal relations tend to be time- varying and demand proper time series partitioning for effective analyses. The prior approaches extract one causal graph given long- time observations, which cannot be directly applied to capturing, interpreting, and validating dynamic urban causality. This paper presents Compass, a novel visual analytics approach for in- depth analyses of the dynamic causality in urban time series. To develop Compass, we identify and address three challenges: detecting urban causality, interpreting dynamic causal relations, and unveiling suspicious causal relations. First, multiple causal graphs over time among urban time series are obtained with a causal detection framework extended from the Granger causality test. Then, a dynamic causal graph visualization is designed to reveal the time- varying causal relations across these causal graphs and facilitate the exploration of the graphs along the time. Finally, a tailored multi- dimensional visualization is developed to support the identification of spurious causal relations, thereby improving the reliability of causal analyses. The effectiveness of Compass is evaluated with two case studies conducted on the real- world urban datasets, including the air pollution and traffic speed datasets, and positive feedback was received from domain experts."

Based on the requirements, we further develop Compass, a visual analytics system for the causal analysis of urban time series. Compass addresses the aforementioned three challenges as follows. For the first challenge, we propose a causal detection framework by extending the Granger causality test. This framework includes neighbor index, time partition, and debounce strategies to improve the capability of the causality test for urban time series. For the second challenge, we design a dynamic graph visualization to reveal the temporal variation of the detected causal relations and enable time- oriented drill- down analyses of causal graphs. For the third challenge, we consider the multiple dimensions of causal relations and propose a tailored visualization to expose causality suspiciousness. Finally, two real- world case studies on air pollution and traffic speed datasets, respectively, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. In sum, our contributions are as follows:"

In a revisited compass glyph, arrows still convey the causal directions within a spatial context. The glyph is revised to incorporate the temporal information as follows. The arrow's size encodes the frequency of the causal links with this direction. An offset between the two opposite arrows can be observed if bi- directional relations exist.

Various visualizations have been proposed for this kind of data. Such as dimension reduction [68,88], scatterplot matrix [49], parallel coordinate plot (PCP) [10] and glyphs [82]. This view should satisfy two requirements, showing details and revealing suspiciousness. We have created two alternatives after exploring the design space. The first one is the spreadsheet that is commonly seen as a detail view (Fig. 7b- 1). However, it cannot handle many relations. The second one is the PCP (Fig. 7b- 2) better than the spreadsheet. Numerous causal relations can be displayed. The values of each dimension can be seen in the parallel axes. The first type of suspicious relations can be indicated by the gray lines passing the top of the distance axis (Fig. 7b- 2). Built on the PCP, we adopt scatterplots to visualize the dimensions related to the same causal direction (Fig. 6d). Scatterplots allow another suspiciousness metric, the Pearson's  $r$ , to be encoded using the size that can be accurately perceived. Besides, scatterplots are more familiar to the experts than the PCP."

A causal detection framework and temporal visualizations are combined to unveil these dynamic causalities. The case studies demonstrate the dynamic causalities in air pollution phenomena and traffic situations. The static causal graphs detected by the previous methods will ignore these time- varying cause- effect relationships and thus cannot support accurate and informed decisions.

In terms of application, the two real- world case studies have demonstrated that Compass can be easily applied to the urban time series data from different domains. Other potential applications include analyzing noise pollution [9], water pollution [1], and complex physical systems (e.g., IoT systems of tree ecosystem services [46]). For example, a river can be polluted by its upstream tributaries. Compass can help identify when the river is polluted and reveal which tributaries pollute it for each period when the pollution events are observed. In terms of visual analytics, Compass can be regarded as a model- free visual analytics approach and is not limited to the Granger causality test. Granger causality test is currently the most suitable method for our problem because of its wide use, interpretability, and ability to detect causality based on short partitioned time series. However, some recognized issues of the Granger causality test still exist. For example, it is a linear model [27]. Any better model proposed in the future can be easily integrated into our visual analytics system."

We first extend the Granger causality test and propose a causal detection framework for dynamic urban causality. We then develop Compass by coordinating a set of well- designed visualizations. Compass facilitates analysts to interpret dynamic causal relations and improve causal detection results. We have demonstrated its effectiveness with case studies on real- world datasets and expert interviews. In the future, we will enhance the capability of Compass and deploy it to specific fields."

This study compared the optimization effects of these two methods and developed a new scheme that combines DA and BC simultaneously. Four parallel experiments were conducted during winter 2019: a control experiment directly forecasted by WRF- Chem (experiment name: WRF- Chem); an experiment that assimilated in situ observations based on the GSI (Gridpoint Statistical Interpolation) system (WRF- Chem_DA); an experiment with deep- learning- based BC (WRF- Chem_BC); and an experiment considering the combination of DA on the initial conditions and BC (WRF- Chem_DA_BC). Statistically, the accuracy of  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  predictions could be optimized by both DA and BC for the first 24- h period, and WRF- Chem_BC performed better than WRF- Chem_DA in the initial field, especially in the period of 10–24 h, while the best performance was achieved by combining BC and DA. Throughout the initial 24- h period, compared with the control experiment, the results of WRF- Chem_DA_BC (WRF- Chem_DA, WRF- Chem_BC) showed an improvement in terms of root- mean- square error, with reduction proportions varying from 38.90% to 48.86% (18.88% to 32.44%, 30.10% to 46.08%). Besides having the best optimization effect over the whole domain, the combined method also performed well in different regions: during the forecasting period of 0–24 h, the RMSEs decreased from 32% to 62%, 39% to 57%, 28% to 40%, and 30% to 49% in the Beijing- Tianjin- Hebei, Yangtze River Delta, Central China, and Sichuan Basin urban agglomerations, respectively."

This study compared the optimization effects of these two methods and developed a new scheme that combines DA and BC simultaneously. Four parallel experiments were conducted during winter 2019: a control experiment directly forecasted by WRF- Chem (experiment name: WRF- Chem); an experiment that assimilated in situ observations based on the GSI (Gridpoint Statistical Interpolation) system (WRF- Chem_DA); an experiment with deep- learning- based BC (WRF- Chem_BC); and an experiment considering the combination of DA on the initial conditions and BC (WRF- Chem_DA_BC). Statistically, the accuracy of  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  predictions could be optimized by both DA and BC for the first 24- h period, and WRF- Chem_BC performed better than WRF- Chem_DA in the initial field, especially in the period of 10–24 h, while the best performance was achieved by combining BC and DA.

(2012) used three different assimilation methods with MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) AOD (aerosol optical depth) products and in situ  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  observations, and the results showed that all three methods improved the forecasting of aerosols. Song et al. (2021) used the 3DVAR (three- dimensional variational) approach to jointly assimilate meteorological data and in situ observations to improve the prediction of  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$ . Hong et al. (2022) assimilated in situ observations and satellite data simultaneously to further improve  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  predictions. And in another study, different kinds of data were used in the assimilation of the initial field to analyze the enhancement of  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  forecasts by different assimilation sources (Ma et al., 2024). These previous studies have shown that DA can improve  $\\mathrm{PM}_{2.5}$  predictions by adjusting the initial state of the atmospheric chemistry, but the improvement of the prediction is limited, and the effect of assimilation gradually disappears with long- term integration of the simulation (Ma et al., 2024; Ma et al., 2020; Hong et al., 2022). In addition, the model prediction errors are not only affected by the uncertainty of the initial field, but also various other uncertainties such as those of the meteorological field and the physicochemical reactions (Zhu et al., 2018). Numerical model BC comprehensively considers the systematic errors of the model forecast to improve the forecast accuracy. Different from DA, which is the adjustment of the initial field from the model input perspective, BC is the post- processing of model outputs from the back end of the model, and can to a certain extent make up for the limitations of initial field DA."

As can be seen, WRF- Chem overestimated the  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  concentrations over some areas of SCB, CC, and YRD, with the prediction MB values reaching  $60\\mu \\mathrm{g} / \\mathrm{m}^3$  in some areas. A reason for this might be that the emissions inventory overestimated the winter emissions in the above regions and the model simulation was relatively more uncertain due to the complex terrain (Wei et al., 2022). In contrast, the  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  concentrations were underestimated in BTH, with the prediction MB ranging from  $- 60$  to  $- 20\\mu \\mathrm{g} / \\mathrm{m}^3$ . This performance whereby WRF- Chem always underestimates  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  concentrations over northern areas in China is a common problem, caused by not simulating secondary aerosols or the transformation mechanisms with their gaseous precursors (Ma, 2020; Wei et al., 2022; Qin et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2016). The prediction MB values were reduced by the DA and BC methods, but BC had better effects in terms of prediction improvement. Consistent with the results shown in Fig. 3, despite the adjustment to the original overestimation by DA in WRF- Chem_DA over some regions of SCB and CC, the prediction MB values could still reach  $60\\mu \\mathrm{g} / \\mathrm{m}^3$  in some areas, thus demonstrating some advantages of DA, but with limitations. Compared with the direct predictions of WRF- Chem, the prediction MB values in the WRF- Chem_BC experiment were reduced over most areas due to BC effects. It is worth noting that the original overestimation changed to an underestimation in the WRF- Chem_BC experiment over some regions of YRD and the Shandong Peninsula, which indicated overcorrection by BC. For WRF- Chem_DA_BC, the prediction MB was the smallest among all the experiments, with values less than  $20\\mu \\mathrm{g} / \\mathrm{m}^3$  over most areas. WRF- Chem_DA_BC showed a smaller prediction MB than WRF- Chem_BC, especially over the Shandong Peninsula and YRD regions."

Compared with the direct predictions of WRF- Chem, the prediction MB values in the WRF- Chem_BC experiment were reduced over most areas due to BC effects. It is worth noting that the original overestimation changed to an underestimation in the WRF- Chem_BC experiment over some regions of YRD and the Shandong Peninsula, which indicated overcorrection by BC.

Both DA and BC were able to improve the consistency of the predictions with the observations, but the optimization effects of the BC method were more effective, with correlation coefficients of 0.4 to 0.8. As can be seen, the predictions produced by WRF- Chem_DA_BC showed the strongest consistency with observations, with  $R$  values of 0.7 to 0.85 for most time periods. Therefore, combining DA and BC improved the consistency of the predictions and the observations, and the optimization effect was the best among all the experiments."

It is evident that all three experiments were able to improve the  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  predictions in terms of their RMSEs compared with the control experiment. The variations of the RMSE values produced by WRF- Chem and WRF- Chem_DA were similar to those in the results of previous studies (Hong et al., 2022; Peng et al., 2018a; Peng et al., 2018b; Ma et al., 2024). Both BC and DA reduced the  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  prediction RMSEs throughout the entire 24- h forecasting period, with reductions of  $17.89 - 33.61\\mu \\mathrm{g} / \\mathrm{m}^3$  and  $13.27 - 21.82\\mu \\mathrm{g} / \\mathrm{m}^3$ , respectively. During the first  $0 - 10\\mathrm{h}$ , the optimization effects of DA and BC were similar, but then BC started to perform better during 10- 24 h due to the timeliness of the DA in the initial field, which has also been reported in previous research (Jiang et al., 2013; Ma et al., 2024). Since the optimization of BC was not sensitive to time, the improvement effects could then be maintained, with a normalized RMSE of 0.54 to 0.70, during the 0- 24- h forecasting period. Comparatively, WRF- Chem_DA_BC produced more accurate  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  predictions than WRF- Chem_DA and WRF- Chem_BC during the first 24- h period, with an RMSE reduction of 23.52 to  $35.95\\mu \\mathrm{g} / \\mathrm{m}^3$  owing to the adjustment of the initial field for the model input and the correction of the output at the same time to achieve a double optimization. Overall, despite the positive effects on  $\\mathrm{PM}_{2.5}$  predictions, the optimization achieved by the different experiments varied; specifically, WRF- Chem_DA_BC was best, followed by WRF- Chem_BC, and then finally WRF- Chem_DA. The error values of predictions produced by WRF- Chem and WRF- Chem_DA were close to some previous DA results in China (Peng et al., 2018a; Peng et al., 2018b; Ma et al., 2024)."

The improvement of  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  predictions in BTH in terms of RMSE reductions by BC were more obvious than those by DA, with regional- average normalized RMSEs of 0.78- 0.87 and 0.41- 0.72, respectively, which was consistent with the RMSE and MB distributions. From the perspective of the regional- average RMSE, WRF- Chem_DA_BC produced a reduction in values of  $24.74 - 78.25\\mu \\mathrm{g} / \\mathrm{m}^3$  due to the combination of DA and BC effects, which shows its advantages over the other experiments in the BTH region. Both DA and BC were able to make adjustments to the overestimation of the  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  predictions in the control experiment in YRD and CC. However, despite their similar effects in the first  $10\\mathrm{h}$ , the optimization of BC was much better than DA in the later forecasting period since the effects of DA may decrease with the increase in the forecasting period. In SCB, the optimization of DA was not as good as that in CC and YRD due to the larger uncertainty caused by the complex terrain here (Wei et al., 2022), which caused the relatively similar effects of the WRF- Chem_BC and WRF- Chem_DA_BC experiments here. Overall, the effects of DA over YRD and CC were more obvious than over BTH and SCB. BC led to good performances over the whole 0- 24- h forecasting period, while DA effects may diminish with the increase in forecasting hours. By combining DA and BC in the WRF- Chem_DA_BC experiment, the consistency between  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  predictions and observations was improved greatly, showing the best forecast effects. The normalized RMSEs produced by WRF- Chem_DA_BC over BTH, YRD, CC, and SCB were 0.38- 0.68, 0.43- 0.61, 0.60- 0.72, and 0.51- 0.70, respectively.

However, despite their similar effects in the first  $10\\mathrm{h}$ , the optimization of BC was much better than DA in the later forecasting period since the effects of DA may decrease with the increase in the forecasting period. In SCB, the optimization of DA was not as good as that in CC and YRD due to the larger uncertainty caused by the complex terrain here (Wei et al., 2022), which caused the relatively similar effects of the WRF- Chem_BC and WRF- Chem_DA_BC experiments here. Overall, the effects of DA over YRD and CC were more obvious than over BTH and SCB. BC led to good performances over the whole 0- 24- h forecasting period, while DA effects may diminish with the increase in forecasting hours. By combining DA and BC in the WRF- Chem_DA_BC experiment, the consistency between  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  predictions and observations was improved greatly, showing the best forecast effects. The normalized RMSEs produced by WRF- Chem_DA_BC over BTH, YRD, CC, and SCB were 0.38- 0.68, 0.43- 0.61, 0.60- 0.72, and 0.51- 0.70, respectively.

      "paragraph_info": "Despite the recent progress in airborne measurements of BBA, large- scale and long- term assessments of the climate impacts of BBA have far relied on global aerosol models (14, 15). However, models have shown substantial discrepancies and errors regarding BBA absorption (16- 19), which remains a key obstacle to reliable climate assessments because BBA absorption can simultaneously contribute to direct, semidirect, and indirect aerosol effects (9, 20). Comparisons between models and satellite observations suggest that global models generally underestimate the overall warming impacts of BBA, as indicated by a substantial underestimation of the aerosol absorption optical depth (AAOD) (21) in combination with an overestimation of the single- scattering albedo (SSA) (20). These findings are supported by flight campaign measurements (22, 23) such as the ObseRvations of Aerosols above CLOUDs and their intEractionS (ORACLES) project (22), suggesting that the overall warming caused by BBA plumes is greater than previously considered, particularly in tropical regions. However, when considering the aerosol composition, global models tend to produce stronger absorption than observed from field and laboratory measurements for a given BC mass mixing ratio (24). The contradiction between the underestimated overall warming and overestimated absorbing capability per unit of BC mass highlights important errors in the emission, composition, and optical properties of absorbing BBA. Although there have been discussions regarding the possible reasons for these model errors [e.g., particle size distribution, vertical profiles, mixing states, and refractive index (24- 28)], a quantitative evaluation of how these factors contribute to the overall errors is still missing. This poses a fundamental challenge to the aerosol modeling community, which hinders reliable climate assessments over tropical regions."

      "paragraph_info": "Despite the recent progress in airborne measurements of BBA, large- scale and long- term assessments of the climate impacts of BBA have far relied on global aerosol models (14, 15). However, models have shown substantial discrepancies and errors regarding BBA absorption (16- 19), which remains a key obstacle to reliable climate assessments because BBA absorption can simultaneously contribute to direct, semidirect, and indirect aerosol effects (9, 20). Comparisons between models and satellite observations suggest that global models generally underestimate the overall warming impacts of BBA, as indicated by a substantial underestimation of the aerosol absorption optical depth (AAOD) (21) in combination with an overestimation of the single- scattering albedo (SSA) (20). These findings are supported by flight campaign measurements (22, 23) such as the ObseRvations of Aerosols above CLOUDs and their intEractionS (ORACLES) project (22), suggesting that the overall warming caused by BBA plumes is greater than previously considered, particularly in tropical regions. However, when considering the aerosol composition, global models tend to produce stronger absorption than observed from field and laboratory measurements for a given BC mass mixing ratio (24). The contradiction between the underestimated overall warming and overestimated absorbing capability per unit of BC mass highlights important errors in the emission, composition, and optical properties of absorbing BBA. Although there have been discussions regarding the possible reasons for these model errors [e.g., particle size distribution, vertical profiles, mixing states, and refractive index (24- 28)], a quantitative evaluation of how these factors contribute to the overall errors is still missing. This poses a fundamental challenge to the aerosol modeling community, which hinders reliable climate assessments over tropical regions."

To achieve this goal, we use the linear relationship observed by (24) between rBC and SSA to estimate ambient rBC from satellite observations of SSA. AeroCom models allow us to establish a relationship between ambient and emitted rBC, which, in any case, is close to identical (see Materials and Methods). These constrained BC and OA emissions can be compared with four widely used inventories of BC and OC emissions [i.e., Global Fire Emission Database version 4.1s (GFED), Global Fire Assimilation System version 1.2 (GFAS), Fire Energetics and Emission Research version 1.2 (FEER), and Quick Fire Emissions Dataset version 2.5 (QFED)], providing that we have reasonable OA/OC ratios (Fig. 4). Field measurements of primary BBA emissions exhibit a narrow range (1.5 to 1.9) for OA/OC (33- 39). We find that most inventories estimate lower emissions than our estimates over Africa, which partly explains the negative AAOD bias (Fig. 3B), as these inventories are used in AeroCom models (table S1)."

The corrections reduce the modeled uncertainty in the direct radiative effects by  $71\\%$  (from 4.5 to  $1.3 \\mathrm{~W} \\mathrm{~m}^{- 2}$ ) over the BB source regions, with an even larger reduction in the outflow areas (by  $86\\%$  from 4.2 to  $0.6 \\mathrm{~W} \\mathrm{~m}^{- 2}$ ). This indicates the potential of our methodology to greatly reduce the overall uncertainty of the aerosol climate impacts. The results also suggest the necessity of dealing with errors in refractive index, particle size distribution, and precipitation in models for future model development."

To characterize satellite errors, we consider three datasets: the Polarization and Directionality of the Earth's Reflectances with the Generalized Retrieval of Aerosol and Surface Properties (POLDER- GRASP) algorithm, the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) with UV aerosol algorithm (OMAERUV), and the Advanced Along- Track Scanning Radiometer with Optimal Retrieval of Aerosol and Cloud algorithm (AATSR- ORAC). We validate the three datasets against AERONET data (the locations of the AERONET sites used in this study are shown in fig. S1) following the procedure in (47) and find that POLDER- GRASP exhibits the lowest error and has the highest correlations with AERONET data for both AAOD and SSA (fig. S16). Therefore, we use POLDER- GRASP as the satellite observation (including AE) during 2010 fire seasons throughout the analysis. However, even for POLDER- GRASP, large retrieval errors exist, which contribute substantially to the overall uncertainties presented in this work."

The emission is calculated as the total of the BC and OA emissions; lifetime is calculated as the (burden of  $\\mathrm{BC + OA}$ )/emission of  $\\mathrm{BC + OA}$ , and MAC is AAOD/(burden of  $\\mathrm{BC + OA}$ ). All the variables are calculated as regional fire- season averages. Other absorbing components (e.g., dust) are assumed to have negligible impacts given the small contribution indicated by the observations (50) and AeroCom models (4%) for the two regions. In addition, we find a small absorption AE from POLDER- GRASP observations (fig. S19), suggesting that brown carbon is not important (51, 52). Note that the emission in Eq. 1 includes both primary emissions and those from secondary formation (SOA), as the latter happens on a much smaller time scale than the seasonal average that we are working with."

We design a two- level visualization mechanism based on the classic Storyline representation to support effective visual analysis of large- scale ST series in a spatiotemporal context.

For each time stamp in the line chart, we have a set of values, each of which is from a normalized sub- ST series. Afterward, we obtain the lower quartile  $q_{n}(0.25)$ , median, and upper quartile  $q_{n}(0.75)$  for these values. Finally, the lower and upper quartiles in all time stamps are visualized with an area. The medians in all time stamps form a median line. The line is superimposed with the area, constituting a trend motif.

Afterward (Day 4), the purple and green ST series became uncorrelated as the purple ST ones continuously increased while the green ones fluctuated. They separated into left and right regions (Fig. 1D4). Second, the black ST series were less correlated with others and the readings did not rise very high (Fig. 1E1). It might be because of the sea breeze blowing from three sides blew away air pollution quickly. Finally, the red ST series experienced a decrease on the third day, followed by an increase during the final three days, whereas the other ST series remained on a downward trend (Fig. 1E and F). A hypothesis suggests that during the last three days, an additional pollution source may have polluted the BTH region.

The two- level visualizations built on it also have intuitive and simple encodings. In the first level, GeoChron uses the gradient shade and color to encode the temporal trends and geographic distribution, respectively. In the second level, GeoChron employs line charts to visualize the temporal trends in a familiar way."

      "paragraph_info": "Abstract- Spatial time series visualization offers scientific research pathways and analytical decision- making tools across various spatiotemporal domains. Despite many advanced methodologies, the seamless integration of temporal and spatial information remains a challenge. The space- time cube (STC) stands out as a promising approach for the synergistic presentation of spatial and temporal information, with successful applications across various spatiotemporal datasets. However, the STC is plagued by well- known issues such as visual occlusion and depth ambiguity, which are further exacerbated when dealing with large- scale spatial time series data. In this study, we introduce a novel technical framework termed VolumeSTCube, designed for continuous spatiotemporal phenomena. It first leverages the concept of the STC to transform discretely distributed spatial time series data into continuously volumetric data. Subsequently, volume rendering and surface rendering techniques are employed to visualize the transformed volumetric data. Volume rendering is utilized to mitigate visual occlusion, while surface rendering provides pattern details by enhanced lighting information. Lastly, we design interactions to facilitate the exploration and analysis from temporal, spatial, and spatiotemporal perspectives. VolumeSTCube is evaluated through a computational experiment, a real- world case study with one expert, and a controlled user study with twelve non- experts, compared against a baseline from prior work, showing its superiority and effectiveness in large- scale spatial time series analysis."

Assuming we are visualizing the ST series of air pollution concentration, below are some examples: If a voxel cluster extends significantly in the vertical direction and over the x- y plane, it indicates that the duration of poor air quality persists across a vast spatial area (Figure 3A①). If in a vertical cylindrical area in 3D cube space are voxel clusters with equal spacing, the air pollution exhibits periodicity at that location (Figure 3A②). If the voxel cluster exhibits shifts in 3D cube space, it indicates a process of air pollution propagation (Figure 3B and C)."

To this end, we allow rendering isosurfaces given an iso- threshold  $\\lambda_i$  within the volume visualization above. By default,  $\\lambda_i = \\lambda_v$ . To do that, we only need to make the transparency of voxels with a value equal to  $\\lambda_i$  equal to 1. That is, each voxel on the rendered surface has a value equal to  $\\lambda_i$ . Users can trigger the surface visualization and interactively adjust  $\\lambda_i$  via a slider.

In sum, the dataset comprises 448 (stations)  $\\times 8,472$  (timesteps) values, ranging from 0 to 500. Each value in the dataset is the AQI at the timestamp of a monitoring station. The higher the value, the worse the air quality. In the data transformation procedure, the parameters of the Gaussian model are automatically determined by the PyKridge library. We evaluated the accuracy of the adopted Kriging interpolation on the dataset and found it to be acceptable, ensuring the reliability of subsequent analyses. For detailed results, please refer to Appendix D. The parameters of DBSCAN,  $\\epsilon$  and MinPts, are configured as 10 and 100, respectively, after multiple trials.

Nonetheless, our study shows that the STC's effectiveness can be enhanced by reducing occlusion through data transformation combined with volume and surface visualizations. Furthermore, to improve the STC's adaptability to large-scale datasets, we design interactions for users to manipulate the STC from time and space dimensions, corresponding to spatial and temporal selection interactions common in 2D views. In the case study, the expert comprehensively analyzed an quality in China, demonstrating VolumeSTCube's effectiveness. The user study employed carefully designed tasks that required participants to utilize both volume and surface visualizations, alongside interactions such as volume spotlight, slicing, and voxel cluster-based techniques, to complete the analyses. The high accuracy and efficiency observed in task completion indicate that participants mastered VolumeSTCube, further underscoring its usability, effectiveness, and broad applicability."
