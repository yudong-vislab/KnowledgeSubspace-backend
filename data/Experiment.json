To measure the error, we alternately set the air pollution value of each existed input pixel to zero, keep other data of that pixel unchanged, running the trained model on this modified input data and calculate RMSE between the inferred value with the actual pixel value of the same position. The final error is the mean of all errors after doing this procedure with all existing air pollution values. We call this error spRMSE, which means the RMSE caused by spatiotemporal factors. The experiments results are shown in Table III. We can notice that ConvLSTM + Speed model has a better spRMSE than ConvLSTM in spite it has worse overall RMSE; which indicates the driving average speed affects air pollution in spatiotemporal form.

In general, Beijing and Tianjin have worse air quality and Shenzhen and Guangzhou are better. As Beijing has the most complicated air quality, we focus on Beijing's data when comparing with different baselines, while showing overall results for the other eight cities. Table 2 details the statistical results about Beijing dataset. To predict the air quality of 36 monitoring stations in Beijing, 74 neighbor stations within 100km (semidiameter) to Beijing are retrieved. Among all air quality records, 2.3% cases are sudden changes. In the experiments, the data in the first 24 months is used for training, and the data in last 12 months is used for testing.",

Certain alkaline molecules, including amines (e.g., dimethylamine \u2013 DMA) and ammonia (NH3) have been shown to substantially enhance nucleation and reduce evaporation by stabilizing atmospheric SA in chamber studies (Almeida et al., 2013). Furthermore, oxygenated organic molecules (OOMs) can also contribute to NPF and subsequent particle growth, even without the inclusion of SA (Kirkby et al., 2016; Xiao et al., 2021). As shown in Fig. 3a, most of the measurements were above the SA\u2013NH<sup>3</sup> system at 278 K from the CLOUD chamber, suggesting that the SA\u2013NH<sup>3</sup> mechanism itself cannot solely explain the measured J1.<sup>7</sup> and that other species are most likely participating in NPF in the Po Valley. For instance, amines, such as DMA or trimethylamine (TMA), with higher basicity may contribute to NPF, consistent with non-negligible concentrations of amines in previous studies in the aerosol at SPC (Paglione et al., 2014; Decesari et al., 2014). For the whole sampling period, the median SA and J1.<sup>7</sup> values in the Po Valley follow the SA\u2013DMA\u2013NH<sup>3</sup> (4 ppt DMA and 1 ppb NH3) and SA\u2013DMA\u2013NH3\u2013Org (adding additional oxidized aromatic organics; Xiao et al., 2021) lines from the CLOUD chamber at 293 K, even though the average noontime temperature was around 285 K during most of the NPF days (Fig. 3a).",

From our cluster kinetics simulations, during the peak hours of NPF, DMA concentrations are expected to be in the range of  $0.1$  to  $5 \\text{ ppt}$ , which is lower than the requirement to reach the kinetic limit (Figs. 3b and S3). This implies that other factors, e.g., the abundant ambient NH<sub>3</sub> ( $\\sim 10 \\text{ ppb}$ ) or TMA during our study period, may also participate in cluster formation. This is consistent with the Vocus measurement, which suggests that the ambient DMA signals were close to the background levels (Fig. S4). Possible reasons for not reaching SA-DMA limit during the campaign could be  $(1)$  the relatively lower DMA emissions (such as vehicle flows) than those in Chinese megacities (Ge et al., 2011; Zhu et al., 2022) and (2) the quick scavenging caused by photolysis and nighttime high RH (85 %) (Leng et al., 2015; Yao et al., 2016).

Through direct ion cluster measurement, kinetic models and comparison with the CLOUD chamber experiment, we have determined that sulfuric acid\u2013base nucleation is the dominant formation mechanism in the Po Valley region. Abundant sulfuric acid and alkaline molecules, including amines and ammonia derived from agriculture activities, provided ample precursors for NPF events. In contrast to megacity environments, the CS showed no significant difference between NPF event days and non-event days, indicating that it is more the abundance of precursors than the variations in the sink controlling the occurrence of NPF in the Po Valley. Furthermore, we observed that, apart from DMA, a typical basic precursor, NH<sup>3</sup> and other amines were also likely to be involved in NPF in the Po Valley. This was supported by the high abundance of SA\u2013NH<sup>3</sup> and SA\u2013NH3\u2013amine clusters measured by the APi-ToF during NPF events. DMA, while more efficient than ammonia, was insufficient to stabilize all SA during our sampling period. This resulted in a more scattered correlation between sulfuric acid concentrations and measured formation rates compared with Chinese megacities. In that sense, we could show that the clustering during NPF is clearly distinct between polluted megacity environments and polluted semi-urbanized regions such as the Po Valley. Similar to Beijing, we found that OOMs did not play a decisive role in initial cluster formation, likely due to the absence of ultra-low-volatility organics (typical OOM dimers) in the ion and neutral cluster measurements. However, low-volatility organics were abundant enough to induce fast growth processes above 3 nm. The comparable GRs and formation rates, along with the lower efficient CS compared with megacity environments, indicate a high survival probability for the newly formed particles. Therefore, NPF is likely to play an important role in the fine-particle concentrations and pollution levels in the Po Valley region. Further reductions in key NPF species, including SO2, amines and NH3, can contribute to suppressing the NPF event frequency and lowering particle numbers. This, in turn, would improve air quality in the Po Valley region.",

        "paragraph_info": "Aerosol ON was measured bihourly using our newly developed analytical system, which enables sensitive and simultaneous measurements of aerosol ON and IN. Detailed descriptions of the new method can be found in our previous work (Yu et al., 2021, 2023). In brief, the analyzer system integrates two commercial instruments: an online aerosol carbon (C) analyzer and a chemiluminescence  $NO_x$  analyzer. Carbonaceous and nitrogenous aerosols collected on quartz filters were thermally evolved under programmed temperatures and then catalytically oxidized to  $CO_2$  and nitrogen oxides ( $NO_{\\nu}$ ), respectively. The C signal was monitored using the non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) method, while the N signal was recorded through chemiluminescence detection after converting  $NO_{\\nu}$  to NO. The C signal assists in differentiating IN and ON components since ON aerosols produce both C and N signals, while the IN fraction only gives an N signal. The programmed thermal evolution facilitates the separation of aerosol IN and ON, as they exhibit distinct thermal characteristics. The quantification of IN and ON is achieved through multivariate curve resolution data treatment of C and N thermal fractions (Yu et al., 2021).",

The measurement principle and operational procedure of the TAG system have been described in detail in previous studies (Williams et al., 2006; He et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2021). In brief, the TAG system operated at a time resolution of 2 h. During the first hour, ambient air was drawn through a  $PM_{2.5}$  cyclone at a flow rate of  $10 \\text{ L min}^{-1}$ , passing through a carbon denuder to remove the gas phase, and particles were then collected onto a thermal desorption cell (CTD). In the second hour, the collected particles underwent thermal desorption and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. In each analysis, 5 \u00b5L of an internal standard mixture was added to the CTD that was loaded with particles collected in the preceding hour. During the thermal desorption step, the polar organic compounds in the  $PM_{2.5}$  were derivatized to their trimethylsilyl derivatives under a helium stream saturated with the derivatization agent Nmethyl-N-(trimethylsilyl) trifluoroacetamide (MSTFA). Subsequently, the organic compounds were reconcentrated onto a focusing trap cooled by a fan. Following this, the CTD was purged with pure helium to remove excess MSTFA, and the focusing trap was heated to  $330\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  to transfer the organic compounds into the valveless injection system, which utilizes a restrictive capillary tube to connect to the GC inlet. The GC-MS analysis was then initiated. A total of approximately 100 polar and non-polar organic compounds could be identified and quantified with authentic standards (Zhu et al., 2021). The individual TAG-measured source tracers used for PMF receptor modeling are listed in Table S1 in the Supplement.",

The combined N content in the four nitroaromatic compounds averaged at 1.14 ngN m\u2212<sup>3</sup> , accounting for approximately 2 % of the estimated total nitroaromatic-N. In most cases (> 90 %), the speciated nitroaromatic-N represented less than 10 % of total nitroaromatic-N (Fig. S10a). Nitroaromatic compounds are known for their remarkable contributions to aerosol light absorption, and some are recognized as toxicants (Laskin et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2023).

We identified 17 such cases during the field observation period. Interestingly, DCA\\_ON showed a strong correlation with  $NH_4^+$  in all these cases (Fig. 3a). This result lends support for the hypothesis that DCA\\_ON may represent reduced ON species formed through the reactions between DCAs and  $NH_3 / NH_4^+$ . The slopes of linear regression between DCA\\_ON and  $NH_{4}^{+}$  varied largely among the cases and could be roughly divided into higher-slope cases and lower-slope cases, with 7 and 10 in these two categories, respectively (Fig. 3a). A higherslope value indicated a more rapid formation of DCA\\_ON at a given concentration level of  $NH_4^+$ . The higher-slope cases were distinctly associated with higher  $O_3$  concentration (Fig. 3b), suggesting an elevated oxidation capacity and hence enhanced formation of secondary products such as DCAs, which serve as the precursors of DCA\\_ON. This argument was supported by the overall higher increment of DCAs concentration in the higher-slope cases (Fig. 3b). Note that the aqueous formation of imines such as imidazoles through the reactions between carbonyls and  $NH_3 / NH_4^+$  has been established in laboratory studies (Galloway et al., 2009; Noziere et al., 2009) and confirmed by field observations (Zhang et al., 2020; Lian et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2023). Considering the close relationship between carbonyls and DCAs, the possibility that imines contributed to DCA\\_ON could not be excluded. Overall, while we acknowledge that a positive correlation with  $NH_4^+$  is not exclusive to DCA\\_ON, the combination of observational evidence described above and mechanistic plausibility strengthens our interpretation that the DCA-related ON probably contributes to reduced ON formation.",

Based on this concept, we follow a depth-first search procedure outlined as follows: starting from a random transportation graph, we recursively add the transportation graphs that are spatiotemporally continuous with the added ones to the propagation graph. To simulate the decomposition of air pollutants, we limit the maximum time span of the propagation graph to 200 hours, as recommended by the experts. By repeating this procedure, we are able to generate a massive number of propagation graphs  $pG = (V, E)$  until all the transportation graphs have been visited. The attributes associated with the nodes and edges in the propagation graphs are identical to those in the transportation graphs.

        "paragraph_info": "**Abstract:** In recent years, frequent occurrences of significant air pollution events in China have routinely caused panic and are a major topic of discussion by the public and air pollution experts in government and academia. Therefore, this study proposed an efficient visualization method to represent directly, quickly, and clearly the spatio-temporal information contained in air pollution data. Data quality check and cleansing during a preliminary visual analysis is presented in tabular form, heat matrix, or line chart, upon which hypotheses can be deduced. Further visualizations were designed to verify the hypotheses and obtain useful findings. This method was tested and validated in a year-long case study of the air quality index (AQI of PM2.5) in Beijing, China. We found that PM2.5, PM10, and NO<sup>2</sup> may be emitted by the same sources, and strong winds may accelerate the spread of pollutants. The average concentration of PM2.5 in Beijing was greater than the AQI value of 50 over the six-year study period. Furthermore, arable lands exhibited considerably higher concentrations of air pollutants than vegetation-covered areas. The findings of this study showed that our visualization method is intuitive and reliable through data quality checking and information sharing with multi-perspective air pollution graphs. This method allows the data to be easily understood by the public and inspire or aid further studies in other fields.",

        "paragraph_info": "Air composition analysis and remote-sensing methods require complex computations and are time consuming. Moreover, the current graphical approaches for air pollution analysis lack interactive and sharable multi-perspective visualizations. The public urgently needs rapid and reliable knowledge on air pollution to make daily decisions. Similarly, most of the government staff are not professionals and need intuitive understanding of the conditions before they can execute any actions against the increasingly serious air pollutants. Thus, a visual methodology is needed for efficient and reliable exploration, particularly in the case of air pollution data, to improve the depth, readability, and accuracy of data analysis. We were motivated by the idea of visual thinking and the geovisualization concept [\\[12\\]](#page-18-15), which may be well suited for the exploration of air pollution data. Building on the extensive body of previous work, our paper presents a visualization exploration method that realizes the process of observation\u2013hypothesis\u2013verification. This method was tested and validated in a year-long case study of the air quality index (AQI of  $PM_{2.5}$ ) in Beijing, China. The useful findings of air pollution in Beijing show that our new method extends the existing work and fills a gap in the research, focusing on visual exploration to support various applications, such as knowledge-based decision making and aided research of air pollution.",
