Here, sudden changes mean that air quality index (AQI) drops very sharply in a very short time span [7]. As illustrated in Figure 2(b), AOI of air quality monitoring station  $S_2$  at the 30<sup>th</sup> timestamp drops over 200 in the coming two hours due to a strong wind blowing from the southeast. Such a sudden change is very important to real-time monitoring and further data analysis. In daily life, most people always pay more attention to sudden changes than to general cases, as they only care about future air quality once the air is polluted seriously and want to know how long it will be good. However, the presence of sudden changes is very infrequent in whole datasets. Among entire observations of three-year air quality data in Beijing, the presence of sudden changes is less than 2.3%. Such data imbalance phenomenon brings much difficulty for air quality prediction.",
