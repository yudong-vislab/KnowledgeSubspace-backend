The unsteadiness of the flame can be present locally or globally in supersonic combustion, for instance, reactant mixing, ignition, flame stabilization, and blow-off. Thus, unsteady supersonic combustion is an urgent problem that needs to be solved for real scramjet engine applications. This work helps to advance the knowledge of dual-mode scramjet combustion operating with different equivalence ratios by conducting quantitative analyses that characterize flame dynamics under flow separation. A hydrogenfueled direct-injection scheme was computed using *blastFoam* code via large-eddy simulation of a scramjet test rig at a stagnation temperature of 950 K and a pressure of 0.82 MPa. The computational results were in good agreement with the experimental data, and two typical flame structures (cavity shear-layer and cavity assisted jet-wake stabilized flame) corresponding to the scram/ram operating modes were reproduced. The local flame structure and flow regime were investigated using a modified flame index and filter functions. A particular focus was set on the continuous flame flashback during mode transition, which could be divided into three stages involving jet/shear-layer interaction, unsteady heat release, and the establishment of a large-area separation zone, with the decay of the cavity recirculation zone. Additionally, the unsteady jet-wake ram combustion presented three oscillation modes, giving rise to intermittent flameout of varying levels. The coherent-structures motion caused by the combined effects of low-speed separated flow and the fuel-jet was the main cause for this kind of unsteady combustion."

Thus, unsteady supersonic combustion is an urgent problem that needs to be solved for real scramjet engine applications. This work helps to advance the knowledge of dual-mode scramjet combustion operating with different equivalence ratios by conducting quantitative analyses that characterize flame dynamics under flow separation. A hydrogenfueled direct-injection scheme was computed using *blastFoam* code via large-eddy simulation of a scramjet test rig at a stagnation temperature of 950 K and a pressure of 0.82 MPa. The computational results were in good agreement with the experimental data, and two typical flame structures (cavity shear-layer and cavity assisted jet-wake stabilized flame) corresponding to the scram/ram operating modes were reproduced. The local flame structure and flow regime were investigated using a modified flame index and filter functions. A particular focus was set on the continuous flame flashback during mode transition, which could be divided into three stages involving jet/shear-layer interaction, unsteady heat release, and the establishment of a large-area separation zone, with the decay of the cavity recirculation zone. Additionally, the unsteady jet-wake ram combustion presented three oscillation modes, giving rise to intermittent flameout of varying levels. The coherent-structures motion caused by the combined effects of low-speed separated flow and the fuel-jet was the main cause for this kind of unsteady combustion."

      "paragraph_info": "A fixed-geometry DMSJ engine's mode transition control is often achieved by altering the fuel injection regularity [\\[4](#page-11-0)]. Tian et al. [\\[5](#page-11-0)] experimentally studied the combustion mode in a hydrogenfueled direct-injection scramjet and found that the transition threshold equivalence ratio (*ER*) was 0.23 under Mach 4 flight conditions. Zhang et al. [\\[6\\]](#page-11-0) investigated the transition process via an experiment with a continuous increase in equivalence ratio, and concluded that the large equivalence ratio slope would not lead to slope variation of pressure rising even at high Mach numbers. The mode transition process in a strut-based combustor with a combined injection strategy was numerically explored by Huang et al. [\\[7](#page-11-0)], and it was reported that the airflow conditions and the jet to crossflow pressure ratio both had a large impact except the injection strategy. By varying the injection pressure, Yan et al. [\\[8\\]](#page-11-0) compared the transition processes from scram to ram and from ram to scram. The results revealed that the transition from ram to scram was more challenging than from scram to ram, and the shock waves were still in the isolator when the combustor entered scram mode. Also, a lot of effort has been put into studying the mechanisms that stabilize combustion [\\[5,9](#page-11-0)–[11\\]](#page-11-0). Three common stabilization modes may be distinguished [\\[9](#page-11-0)] based on where the flame anchors: cavity shear-layer stabilized combustion, cavity assisted jet-wake stabilized combustion, and combined cavity shear-layer/recirculation stabilized combustion. The correlation between operating and stabilization modes of the DMSJ combustor was further investigated by Yuan et al. [\\[10\\]](#page-11-0), who observed that the flame was stabilized in the cavity shear-layer at scram mode while in the jet-wake at ram mode."

[[5](#page-11-0)]. The primary objective is to obtain a comprehensive understanding of flow characteristics, flame stabilization mechanisms, and unsteady flame dynamics in separated flow. The paper is structured as follows: The next section describes the methodology and quantitative comparison. After that a phenomenological description of flame stabilization mechanism is presented following a comprehensive analysis of the optical and numerical images. Then, the combustion and flow regimes are vividly demonstrated. Subsequently, the temporal evolution of dynamic behaviors, including mode transition and oscillating flame, is characterized to reveal the potential control mechanism. Finally, some significant conclusions are drawn."

Further topologically identical coarser (1.0 million) and finer (7.0 million) grids are generated for case 1 in order to do a grid independence study. The pressure distributions on the upper wall are shown to be nearly identical apart from the leading edge of the expansion section, where the moderate and finer grids predict lower values than the coarser one, which is consistent with what was seen in Cao's investigations [\\[11](#page-11-0)]. This might be due to local refinement capturing multiscale turbulence at the expansion fan. The simulations for both cases are conducted on the moderate grid (5.0 million) in order to make a compromise between the fidelity and efficiency. As can be seen in Fig. [3,](#page-4-0) the pressure distribution on the upper wall matches the experimental results well for both cases except the separation point pressure in the isolator for case 2, which is slightly overpredicted. The absence of good near-wall resolution might be the most important factor among the other factors explaining the overprediction. In addition, a sharp pressure drop can also be observed owing to the rapid expansion of a high-pressure jet near the inlet, but it is not captured by the discrete pressure measurements. Anyway, these discrepancies are all acceptable."

Building upon previous studies by Yuan et al. [\\[10](#page-11-0)], it is found that during scram mode, the fuel jet splits the cavity into two distinct regions: a rich-premixed zone and a hot product zone. The resulting flame in the cavity is discontinuous and is stabilized within the shear layers of recirculation zones. The shear layer and fuel jet impede supersonic inflow, creating reflected shocks and a bow shock. On the other hand, during ram mode operation, the flame is stabilized in the jet-wake. Furthermore, the corner recirculation zone plays a vital role in maintaining continuous ignition of the fuel jet. Although there is no primary recirculation zone within the cavity, the hot products that flow downstream have positive effects on the jet-wake flame. This is because pure jet-wake stabilized combustion is not attainable under low inflow stagnation temperatures [\\[9\\]](#page-11-0). Additionally, the shear layer and shock train exhibit violent oscillations due to large-scale vortex shedding. As a result, the flow field is complex and intrinsically unstable."

In ram mode (case 2), the ratios of supersonic and subsonic downstream flow are almost symmetrical. One may observe that their ratios are equal at *x* = 175 mm, with each accounting for 50%. After that, the supersonic downstream flow ratio experiences a brief rise before declining to its minimum value (43%) at the thermal throat.

It is convincing that the most energetic POM (mode #1) is in close proximity to the dominant flame mode. Similar consistency is also observed in the lower-frequency modes. The spatial structures of the first three POMs are depicted in Fig. 15(b). In mode #1, the rapid exchange of momentum generates a pair of counter-rotating vortices when the high-speed jet penetrates the low-speed separated flow. The upstream vortex, which directly interacts with the fuel jet, explains the periodic variation in the penetration depth of the jet, while the downstream vortex determines the oscillation characteristics of the flame. In mode #2, a similar but larger counter-rotating vortex pair is generated, and the upstream vortex extends to the tail of the isolator. Mode #3 embodies the coherent structures that are related to the largest-amplitude flame oscillation. A single large vortex can be observed at the cavity exit, which occupies the entire height and entrains the flame into the cavity floor, consistent with the previous analyses. The vortex is generated by the sudden contraction of the channel when entering the expansion section. Therefore, it is expected that low-frequency oscillations of this kind can be suppressed by optimizing the dimensional parameters of the combustor."

It is convincing that the most energetic POM (mode #1) is in close proximity to the dominant flame mode. Similar consistency is also observed in the lower-frequency modes. The spatial structures of the first three POMs are depicted in Fig. 15(b). In mode #1, the rapid exchange of momentum generates a pair of counter-rotating vortices when the high-speed jet penetrates the low-speed separated flow. The upstream vortex, which directly interacts with the fuel jet, explains the periodic variation in the penetration depth of the jet, while the downstream vortex determines the oscillation characteristics of the flame. In mode #2, a similar but larger counter-rotating vortex pair is generated, and the upstream vortex extends to the tail of the isolator. Mode #3 embodies the coherent structures that are related to the largest-amplitude flame oscillation. A single large vortex can be observed at the cavity exit, which occupies the entire height and entrains the flame into the cavity floor, consistent with the previous analyses. The vortex is generated by the sudden contraction of the channel when entering the expansion section. Therefore, it is expected that low-frequency oscillations of this kind can be suppressed by optimizing the dimensional parameters of the combustor."

The first one was represented by a swing flame with large-amplitude flame flashback caused by jet/shear-layer interaction. The second one was characterized by the high-frequency flame flashback induced by unsteady heatrelease. In the last one, the intensive heat-release promoted the establishment of a large-area separation zone, which led to the oscillation of combustion mode followed by the complete transition. In addition, the unsteady jet-wake ram combustion presented three oscillation modes. The presence of a counter-rotating vortex pair in the front part of the cavity (10476 Hz and 2381 Hz), and a single large-scale vortex at the cavity exit (476 Hz) sustained the large-amplitude shear-layer oscillations, which gave rise to the periodic disintegration of the fuel jet, as well as intermittent flameout further downstream."

TemporalFlowViz combines ViT embeddings, interactive trajectory construction, density-based clustering, and expertaugmented semantic summarization to support interpretable analysis of high-dimensional, time-sequenced combustion data. By allowing experts to annotate representative cluster centroids, which then condition a vision–language model for generating frame- and case-level descriptions, we establish a reusable semantic layer that transforms complex flow field patterns into interpretable textual narratives. This multimodal annotation pipeline enables automated reporting, similarity-driven retrieval, and collaborative analysis with minimal manual overhead. We demonstrated the utility of TemporalFlowViz through two expert-driven case studies focusing on pressure and OH field dynamics. These studies revealed the system's ability to distinguish combustion modes, uncover evolution patterns, and support scalable interpretation across parameterized simulations. Expert feedback confirmed that the system accelerates hypothesis validation, reduces cognitive load, and facilitates knowledge sharing across teams. In summary, TemporalFlowViz represents a step toward deeply integrated, expert-informed visual analytics for scientific simulations—fusing deep learning, trajectorybased reasoning, and semantic interpretability into a unified framework for understanding combustion dynamics at scale."

Wang et al. [\\[19](#page-11-0)] have numerically found two flowrelated combustion oscillation mechanisms in the scramjet with hydrogen injected upstream of the cavity. One was the intermittent auto-ignition of mixture packets linked to the fuel jet, and the other was the unsteady flame propagation affected by the jet/cavity shear-layer interaction. In the simulation of a cavityfloor direct-injection scramjet, Sitaraman et al. [\\[22](#page-11-0)] also noticed low-frequency heat release and pressure oscillations and attributed them to the periodic fluctuation of jet penetration brought on by the interaction with the shear layer. In a DMSJ engine, intensive heat release will alter the inflow conditions through the large-scale flow separation induced by upstream-propagating backpressure, which in turn modulates the flame stability downstream [\\[23\\]](#page-11-0).

Consequently, the flame is highly susceptible to the combined effects of large-scale separation vortexes and fuel jet. Even when subjected to severe shear-layer oscillations, the flame is prone to intermittent flameout [\\[9\\]](#page-11-0). In order to examine the impact of coherent structures on flame behavior under the combined action of unstable inflow and vertical jet. This work utilizes the height variation of the *T* = 1800 K isoline at *x* = 220 mm in the center slice to characterize the flame oscillation level, as shown in Fig. 13. The temporal evolution of the flame covers a maximum oscillation period (mode #3) from *t* = 3*.*05 ms to *t* = 4*.*45 ms, during which the flame exhibits the largest amplitude and almost touches the cavity floor. In mode #2 (*t* = 3*.*45 ∼ 3*.*90 ms), the flame position extends beyond the cavity step but does not reach the floor. Fig. [2](#page-4-0) provides a close-up view of mode #2, with the yellow line denoting the dominant mode (mode #1) and a frequency of approximately 8796 Hz. It is evident that the dominant mode corresponds to the self-sustained shear-layer oscillation induced by vortex shedding."

However, the large scale and high dimensionality of simulation-generated temporal flow field data present significant challenges for visual interpretation, feature differentiation, and cross-case comparison. In this paper, we present TemporalFlowViz, a parameter-aware visual analytics workflow and system designed to support expert-driven clustering, visualization, and interpretation of temporal flow fields from scramjet combustion simulations. Our approach leverages hundreds of simulated combustion cases with varying initial conditions, each producing time-sequenced flow field images. We use pretrained Vision Transformers to extract high-dimensional embeddings from these frames, apply dimensionality reduction and density-based clustering to uncover latent combustion modes, and construct temporal trajectories in the embedding space to track the evolution of each simulation over time. To bridge the gap between latent representations and expert reasoning, domain specialists annotate representative cluster centroids with descriptive labels. These annotations are used as contextual prompts for a vision–language model, which generates natural-language summaries for individual frames and full simulation cases. The system also supports parameter-based filtering, similarity-based case retrieval, and coordinated multi-view exploration to facilitate in-depth analysis. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TemporalFlowViz through two expert-informed case studies and expert feedback, showing TemporalFlowViz enhances hypothesis generation, supports interpretable pattern discovery, and enhances knowledge discovery in large-scale scramjet combustion analysis."

TemporalFlowViz combines ViT embeddings, interactive trajectory construction, density-based clustering, and expertaugmented semantic summarization to support interpretable analysis of high-dimensional, time-sequenced combustion data. By allowing experts to annotate representative cluster centroids, which then condition a vision–language model for generating frame- and case-level descriptions, we establish a reusable semantic layer that transforms complex flow field patterns into interpretable textual narratives. This multimodal annotation pipeline enables automated reporting, similarity-driven retrieval, and collaborative analysis with minimal manual overhead. We demonstrated the utility of TemporalFlowViz through two expert-driven case studies focusing on pressure and OH field dynamics. These studies revealed the system's ability to distinguish combustion modes, uncover evolution patterns, and support scalable interpretation across parameterized simulations. Expert feedback confirmed that the system accelerates hypothesis validation, reduces cognitive load, and facilitates knowledge sharing across teams. In summary, TemporalFlowViz represents a step toward deeply integrated, expert-informed visual analytics for scientific simulations—fusing deep learning, trajectorybased reasoning, and semantic interpretability into a unified framework for understanding combustion dynamics at scale."

Further topologically identical coarser (1.0 million) and finer (7.0 million) grids are generated for case 1 in order to do a grid independence study. The pressure distributions on the upper wall are shown to be nearly identical apart from the leading edge of the expansion section, where the moderate and finer grids predict lower values than the coarser one, which is consistent with what was seen in Cao's investigations [\\[11](#page-11-0)]. This might be due to local refinement capturing multiscale turbulence at the expansion fan. The simulations for both cases are conducted on the moderate grid (5.0 million) in order to make a compromise between the fidelity and efficiency. As can be seen in Fig. [3,](#page-4-0) the pressure distribution on the upper wall matches the experimental results well for both cases except the separation point pressure in the isolator for case 2, which is slightly overpredicted. The absence of good near-wall resolution might be the most important factor among the other factors explaining the overprediction. In addition, a sharp pressure drop can also be observed owing to the rapid expansion of a high-pressure jet near the inlet, but it is not captured by the discrete pressure measurements. Anyway, these discrepancies are all acceptable."

The fuel-jet core in case 1 has a branch due to the strong entrainment, and a significant amount of hydrogen collects in the corner to maintain the upstream flame's fuel supply. The downstream flame receives radicals and a hot environment from the cavity recirculation zone, which is located at the rear of the shear-layer. This process is known as cavity shear-layer stabilized combustion. The cold jet penetrates the shear-layer and causes local extinction, in contrast to the outcomes of injection upstream of the cavity [\\[9\\]](#page-11-0). But the whole flame remains stable, since it is mainly held by the vortex interactions with the cavity rather than the streamwise transportation. In case 2, a significant corner recirculation zone is also generated. Nevertheless, its jet momentum is higher and the recirculation velocity is lower than in case 1. In order to prevent hydrogen from being heavily entrained into the corner, hot products collect instead, acting as an ignitor. It is important to note that the cavity lacks a primary recirculation zone, which may be the result of interactions between the fuel jet and low-speed separated flow in a configuration with a large length to depth ratio (L/D = 11). Similarly, it can be inferred as cavity assisted jet-wake stabilized combustion, though it is susceptible to the flow oscillation."

Notably, the pressure waveform measured in the cavity (P1) exhibits a high-frequency oscillation, which can be attributed to the acoustic motion in the subsonic region [\\[22\\]](#page-11-0). Additionally, the pressure response recorded in the tail of the isolator (P2) depicts the upstream propagation of backpressure. Based on the severity of the flame flashback, the entire process can be categorized into three stages. In stage #1, the pressure in the cavity rapidly increases with an increase in injection pressure. Although a weak backpressure is observed in the isolator, a severe flashback phenomenon is observed, which is also evident in the early stage of Fig. 10. This phenomenon is mainly associated with the sudden disturbance of the jet to shear-layer under stronger penetrability. In stage #2, the pressure tendency in the cavity remains relatively stable, and the combustor is in a state of energy accumulation by heat-release. The propagation abilities of backpressure and flame flashback are both weak, while the frequency is notably higher due to unsteady heat-release. In the critical stage of mode transition (stage #3), long-term and large-amplitude pressure responses can be detected in the isolator, indicating the establishment of a large-area separation zone. Furthermore, multiple reciprocating oscillations of the separated flow and continuous severe flame flashback phenomenon can be observed. The obvious large-amplitude oscillation mode with a rapid-growing trend is monitored in the cavity, which is caused by the continuous pressurization and depressurization cycles. It can be inferred that the transient thermal choking occurs in this stage, and the intensive heat-release plays a significant role in promoting the mode transition in this stage."

In order to examine the impact of coherent structures on flame behavior under the combined action of unstable inflow and vertical jet. This work utilizes the height variation of the *T* = 1800 K isoline at *x* = 220 mm in the center slice to characterize the flame oscillation level, as shown in Fig. 13. The temporal evolution of the flame covers a maximum oscillation period (mode #3) from *t* = 3*.*05 ms to *t* = 4*.*45 ms, during which the flame exhibits the largest amplitude and almost touches the cavity floor. In mode #2 (*t* = 3*.*45 ∼ 3*.*90 ms), the flame position extends beyond the cavity step but does not reach the floor. Fig. [2](#page-4-0) provides a close-up view of mode #2, with the yellow line denoting the dominant mode (mode #1) and a frequency of approximately 8796 Hz.

It is convincing that the most energetic POM (mode #1) is in close proximity to the dominant flame mode. Similar consistency is also observed in the lower-frequency modes. The spatial structures of the first three POMs are depicted in Fig. 15(b). In mode #1, the rapid exchange of momentum generates a pair of counter-rotating vortices when the high-speed jet penetrates the low-speed separated flow. The upstream vortex, which directly interacts with the fuel jet, explains the periodic variation in the penetration depth of the jet, while the downstream vortex determines the oscillation characteristics of the flame. In mode #2, a similar but larger counter-rotating vortex pair is generated, and the upstream vortex extends to the tail of the isolator. Mode #3 embodies the coherent structures that are related to the largest-amplitude flame oscillation. A single large vortex can be observed at the cavity exit, which occupies the entire height and entrains the flame into the cavity floor, consistent with the previous analyses. The vortex is generated by the sudden contraction of the channel when entering the expansion section. Therefore, it is expected that low-frequency oscillations of this kind can be suppressed by optimizing the dimensional parameters of the combustor."

Based on domain knowledge, we assigned higher weights to the upper region of the engine, where the OH field exhibited stronger variation and contains more informative flame structures. Less active regions, such as the left portion of the domain, received smaller weights. These weighted OH field images were then encoded into highdimensional embeddings using a pretrained BLIP-2 Vision Transformer (ViT) model, capturing localized combustion characteristics across time."

TemporalFlowViz combines ViT embeddings, interactive trajectory construction, density-based clustering, and expertaugmented semantic summarization to support interpretable analysis of high-dimensional, time-sequenced combustion data. By allowing experts to annotate representative cluster centroids, which then condition a vision–language model for generating frame- and case-level descriptions, we establish a reusable semantic layer that transforms complex flow field patterns into interpretable textual narratives. This multimodal annotation pipeline enables automated reporting, similarity-driven retrieval, and collaborative analysis with minimal manual overhead. We demonstrated the utility of TemporalFlowViz through two expert-driven case studies focusing on pressure and OH field dynamics. These studies revealed the system's ability to distinguish combustion modes, uncover evolution patterns, and support scalable interpretation across parameterized simulations. Expert feedback confirmed that the system accelerates hypothesis validation, reduces cognitive load, and facilitates knowledge sharing across teams. In summary, TemporalFlowViz represents a step toward deeply integrated, expert-informed visual analytics for scientific simulations—fusing deep learning, trajectorybased reasoning, and semantic interpretability into a unified framework for understanding combustion dynamics at scale."

Therein, the flow instabilities may be attributed to the self-sustained cavity shear-layer oscillation [[19\\]](#page-11-0), unsteady jets in supersonic crossflow [[20](#page-11-0)], and separated boundary layers [\\[21\\]](#page-11-0). Wang et al. [\\[19](#page-11-0)] have numerically found two flowrelated combustion oscillation mechanisms in the scramjet with hydrogen injected upstream of the cavity. One was the intermittent auto-ignition of mixture packets linked to the fuel jet, and the other was the unsteady flame propagation affected by the jet/cavity shear-layer interaction. In the simulation of a cavityfloor direct-injection scramjet, Sitaraman et al. [\\[22](#page-11-0)] also noticed low-frequency heat release and pressure oscillations and attributed them to the periodic fluctuation of jet penetration brought on by the interaction with the shear layer. In a DMSJ engine, intensive heat release will alter the inflow conditions through the large-scale flow separation induced by upstream-propagating backpressure, which in turn modulates the flame stability downstream [\\[23\\]](#page-11-0). The possible interaction with fuel jets complicates the instability process even more. According to a series of well-known studies [\\[5,9,24,25\\]](#page-11-0), once the heat release reached a high enough level, there was a noticeable unsteadiness. Wang et al. [\\[26\\]](#page-11-0) experimentally studied the oscillation features of shock-train structures in an isolator with a choked throat, and found that the shock-train oscillation could propagate further downstream along the thicker boundary layer, resulting in drastic coherence and pressure fluctuations in downstream separated flow. Fotia et al. [\\[18](#page-11-0)] carried out an experimental study on the hydrogen-fueled DMSJ engine and observed some low-frequency periodic oscillations of the flame position under the separated flow, which could be correlated with the upstream unsteady pre-combustion shock-train."

The 3-D vortex structures in the cavity of case 2 are found to be larger than those of case 1, primarily initiated by the shock/boundary-layer interaction in the isolator and intensified by thermal expansion in the cavity. Moreover, hairpin-like vortexes induced by the shock/boundary-layer interaction are observed on the lower wall. Both flames are confined in the vortexes that enhance fluid mixing, causing the flame in case 1 to be inside the cavity or close to the upper wall of the expansion section, while that in case 2 oscillates violently and the intermittent blowoff is observed downstream. Fig. [8](#page-7-0)(c) shows the time-averaged Mach number contours, embodying two typical features of a dual-mode scramjet. In scram mode, the flow in almost the entire combustor, except for the cavity, is supersonic.

      "paragraph_info": "Fig. [12](#page-9-0) presents the temporal evolutions of pressure signals and flame flashback distance. Notably, the pressure waveform measured in the cavity (P1) exhibits a high-frequency oscillation, which can be attributed to the acoustic motion in the subsonic region [\\[22\\]](#page-11-0). Additionally, the pressure response recorded in the tail of the isolator (P2) depicts the upstream propagation of backpressure. Based on the severity of the flame flashback, the entire process can be categorized into three stages. In stage #1, the pressure in the cavity rapidly increases with an increase in injection pressure. Although a weak backpressure is observed in the isolator, a severe flashback phenomenon is observed, which is also evident in the early stage of Fig. 10. This phenomenon is mainly associated with the sudden disturbance of the jet to shear-layer under stronger penetrability. In stage #2, the pressure tendency in the cavity remains relatively stable, and the combustor is in a state of energy accumulation by heat-release. The propagation abilities of backpressure and flame flashback are both weak, while the frequency is notably higher due to unsteady heat-release. In the critical stage of mode transition (stage #3), long-term and large-amplitude pressure responses can be detected in the isolator, indicating the establishment of a large-area separation zone. Furthermore, multiple reciprocating oscillations of the separated flow and continuous severe flame flashback phenomenon can be observed. The obvious large-amplitude oscillation mode with a rapid-growing trend is monitored in the cavity, which is caused by the continuous pressurization and depressurization cycles. It can be inferred that the transient thermal choking occurs in this stage, and the intensive heat-release plays a significant role in promoting the mode transition in this stage."

However, the large scale and high dimensionality of simulation-generated temporal flow field data present significant challenges for visual interpretation, feature differentiation, and cross-case comparison. In this paper, we present TemporalFlowViz, a parameter-aware visual analytics workflow and system designed to support expert-driven clustering, visualization, and interpretation of temporal flow fields from scramjet combustion simulations. Our approach leverages hundreds of simulated combustion cases with varying initial conditions, each producing time-sequenced flow field images. We use pretrained Vision Transformers to extract high-dimensional embeddings from these frames, apply dimensionality reduction and density-based clustering to uncover latent combustion modes, and construct temporal trajectories in the embedding space to track the evolution of each simulation over time. To bridge the gap between latent representations and expert reasoning, domain specialists annotate representative cluster centroids with descriptive labels. These annotations are used as contextual prompts for a vision–language model, which generates natural-language summaries for individual frames and full simulation cases. The system also supports parameter-based filtering, similarity-based case retrieval, and coordinated multi-view exploration to facilitate in-depth analysis. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TemporalFlowViz through two expert-informed case studies and expert feedback, showing TemporalFlowViz enhances hypothesis generation, supports interpretable pattern discovery, and enhances knowledge discovery in large-scale scramjet combustion analysis."

It is important to note that the cavity lacks a primary recirculation zone, which may be the result of interactions between the fuel jet and low-speed separated flow in a configuration with a large length to depth ratio (L/D = 11). Similarly, it can be inferred as cavity assisted jet-wake stabilized combustion, though it is susceptible to the flow oscillation."

The propagation abilities of backpressure and flame flashback are both weak, while the frequency is notably higher due to unsteady heat-release.

In mode #2 (*t* = 3*.*45 ∼ 3*.*90 ms), the flame position extends beyond the cavity step but does not reach the floor. Fig. [2](#page-4-0) provides a close-up view of mode #2, with the yellow line denoting the dominant mode (mode #1) and a frequency of approximately 8796 Hz. It is evident that the dominant mode corresponds to the self-sustained shear-layer oscillation induced by vortex shedding."

It is convincing that the most energetic POM (mode #1) is in close proximity to the dominant flame mode. Similar consistency is also observed in the lower-frequency modes. The spatial structures of the first three POMs are depicted in Fig. 15(b). In mode #1, the rapid exchange of momentum generates a pair of counter-rotating vortices when the high-speed jet penetrates the low-speed separated flow. The upstream vortex, which directly interacts with the fuel jet, explains the periodic variation in the penetration depth of the jet, while the downstream vortex determines the oscillation characteristics of the flame. In mode #2, a similar but larger counter-rotating vortex pair is generated, and the upstream vortex extends to the tail of the isolator. Mode #3 embodies the coherent structures that are related to the largest-amplitude flame oscillation. A single large vortex can be observed at the cavity exit, which occupies the entire height and entrains the flame into the cavity floor, consistent with the previous analyses. The vortex is generated by the sudden contraction of the channel when entering the expansion section. Therefore, it is expected that low-frequency oscillations of this kind can be suppressed by optimizing the dimensional parameters of the combustor."

However, the large scale and high dimensionality of simulation-generated temporal flow field data present significant challenges for visual interpretation, feature differentiation, and cross-case comparison. In this paper, we present TemporalFlowViz, a parameter-aware visual analytics workflow and system designed to support expert-driven clustering, visualization, and interpretation of temporal flow fields from scramjet combustion simulations. Our approach leverages hundreds of simulated combustion cases with varying initial conditions, each producing time-sequenced flow field images. We use pretrained Vision Transformers to extract high-dimensional embeddings from these frames, apply dimensionality reduction and density-based clustering to uncover latent combustion modes, and construct temporal trajectories in the embedding space to track the evolution of each simulation over time. To bridge the gap between latent representations and expert reasoning, domain specialists annotate representative cluster centroids with descriptive labels. These annotations are used as contextual prompts for a vision–language model, which generates natural-language summaries for individual frames and full simulation cases. The system also supports parameter-based filtering, similarity-based case retrieval, and coordinated multi-view exploration to facilitate in-depth analysis. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TemporalFlowViz through two expert-informed case studies and expert feedback, showing TemporalFlowViz enhances hypothesis generation, supports interpretable pattern discovery, and enhances knowledge discovery in large-scale scramjet combustion analysis."
