    "paragraph_info": "Abstract— The spatial time series generated by city sensors allow us to observe urban phenomena like environmental pollution and traffic congestion at an unprecedented scale. However, recovering causal relations from these observations to explain the sources of urban phenomena remains a challenging task because these causal relations tend to be time- varying and demand proper time series partitioning for effective analyses. The prior approaches extract one causal graph given long- time observations, which cannot be directly applied to capturing, interpreting, and validating dynamic urban causality. This paper presents Compass, a novel visual analytics approach for in- depth analyses of the dynamic causality in urban time series. To develop Compass, we identify and address three challenges: detecting urban causality, interpreting dynamic causal relations, and unveiling suspicious causal relations. First, multiple causal graphs over time among urban time series are obtained with a causal detection framework extended from the Granger causality test. Then, a dynamic causal graph visualization is designed to reveal the time- varying causal relations across these causal graphs and facilitate the exploration of the graphs along the time. Finally, a tailored multi- dimensional visualization is developed to support the identification of spurious causal relations, thereby improving the reliability of causal analyses. The effectiveness of Compass is evaluated with two case studies conducted on the real- world urban datasets, including the air pollution and traffic speed datasets, and positive feedback was received from domain experts."

    "paragraph_info": "BC is a statistical method that improves model predictions by establishing a relationship between historical observations and the corresponding model forecasts, from which the forecast bias can be extracted and the systematic errors corrected. With the advancements made in this line of research, BC methods have been developed from the earlier complete forecast method (Klein et al., 1959) to the model output statistical method (Glahn and Lowry, 1972), and then gradually evolved into different BC schemes. Frequency matching, Bayesian averaging, least- squares regression, multiple linear regression, and other statistical methods have been used to establish BC models, which significantly reduce systematic errors by learning the empirical relationships between historical forecasts and observations to realize BC (Raftery et al., 2005; Zhu and Luo, 2015; Xie et al., 2012; Chen et al., 2012; You, 2014). Recently, artificial- intelligence machine- learning techniques have emerged. Subsequently, BC based on machine- learning methods has been shown to better express the auxiliary links between various facets of the atmosphere, including, for instance, the different elements involved in atmospheric chemistry and key basic meteorological variables such as temperature and winds (Marzban, 2003; Zhang et al., 2022). Machine- learning models have been used in the BC of model outputs to improve  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  forecasts. For example, Ran et al. (2023) performed BC based on a multiple linear regression modeling approach to reduce the global  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  prediction bias; and Liu and Xing (2022a), Liu and Xing (2022b) designed a fully connected deep neural network to correct the  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  concentration bias in the outputs of chemical models, achieving better results than without the correction method applied. Ma et al. (2020) applied a time series model to correct  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  forecasts, which achieved good results. Different machine- learning methods were utilized by Li et al. (2021) as bias adjustment for postprocessing forecasts of  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  and  $\\mathrm{O}_3$ , showing the optimal approach to be the Random Forest model. Lu et al. (2020) utilized machine- learning methods to improve the accuracy of  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  forecasts through WRF- Chem in the Chengdu- Chongqing region. Overall, machine- learning methods have shown strong advantages in mining nonlinear relationships, enabling them to perform well in the BC of numerical predictions. However, they usually require massive, multi- source data inputs, which can limit their applicability in specific scenarios."

GSI 3DVAR is almost the same as traditional 3D variational methods, which are based on the idea of variational DA. However, it shows advantages in its ability to deal with observations that have complex nonlinear relationships with atmospheric state model variables, thus making it possible to assimilate observations with nonlinear relations to atmospheric state quantities. In order to improve aerosol predictions, an aerosol assimilation module was integrated systematically into the GSI 3DVAR system (Pagowski et al., 2014). In this paper, the DA of the initial field is based on the GSI system at 00:00 UTC each day. The GSI system is fitted to the observation and model background field by minimizing the objective function, and the analytical field is the optimal solution for the minimal value of the objective function in equation (1)."

Fig. 3 shows the spatial performances of  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  prediction RMSEs averaged in winter produced by the different experiments.

By comparing Fig. 3a, 3b and 3c, it can be seen that both DA and BC were able to reduce the  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  prediction RMSE, despite different performances over different regions. Compared with the control experiment, the prediction RMSE in WRF- Chem_DA was  $20 - 40\\mu \\mathrm{g} / \\mathrm{m}^3$  lower over CC and YRD, while the DA improvements were small over BTH, where large RMSE values could still be seen. In contrast, the performances of BC were much better than those of DA, showing RMSE reductions over most areas in China, and the RMSE values were less than  $80\\mu \\mathrm{g} / \\mathrm{m}^3$  in the WRF- Chem_BC experiment. Thus, by combining DA and BC, the best improvements were yielded, showing the largest reductions in prediction RMSE, with values less than  $60\\mu \\mathrm{g} / \\mathrm{m}^3$ , in the WRF- Chem_DA_BC"

    "paragraph_info": "Fig. 4 presents the mean bias distributions of  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  predictions produced by the different experiments. As can be seen, WRF- Chem overestimated the  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  concentrations over some areas of SCB, CC, and YRD, with the prediction MB values reaching  $60\\mu \\mathrm{g} / \\mathrm{m}^3$  in some areas. A reason for this might be that the emissions inventory overestimated the winter emissions in the above regions and the model simulation was relatively more uncertain due to the complex terrain (Wei et al., 2022). In contrast, the  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  concentrations were underestimated in BTH, with the prediction MB ranging from  $- 60$  to  $- 20\\mu \\mathrm{g} / \\mathrm{m}^3$ . This performance whereby WRF- Chem always underestimates  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  concentrations over northern areas in China is a common problem, caused by not simulating secondary aerosols or the transformation mechanisms with their gaseous precursors (Ma, 2020; Wei et al., 2022; Qin et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2016). The prediction MB values were reduced by the DA and BC methods, but BC had better effects in terms of prediction improvement. Consistent with the results shown in Fig. 3, despite the adjustment to the original overestimation by DA in WRF- Chem_DA over some regions of SCB and CC, the prediction MB values could still reach  $60\\mu \\mathrm{g} / \\mathrm{m}^3$  in some areas, thus demonstrating some advantages of DA, but with limitations. Compared with the direct predictions of WRF- Chem, the prediction MB values in the WRF- Chem_BC experiment were reduced over most areas due to BC effects. It is worth noting that the original overestimation changed to an underestimation in the WRF- Chem_BC experiment over some regions of YRD and the Shandong Peninsula, which indicated overcorrection by BC. For WRF- Chem_DA_BC, the prediction MB was the smallest among all the experiments, with values less than  $20\\mu \\mathrm{g} / \\mathrm{m}^3$  over most areas. WRF- Chem_DA_BC showed a smaller prediction MB than WRF- Chem_BC, especially over the Shandong Peninsula and YRD regions."

From the scatter fitting analysis results, WRF- Chem_DA_BC performed best in its consistency with observations following optimization. The results predicted directly by WRF- Chem in the control experiment were dispersed, with some isolated overestimation and underestimation scatter points fitted along the slope of 0.56, which demonstrates poor ability in simulating the high- pollution zones. By applying DA, the predictions of WRF- Chem_DA were partially improved, with an increased fitting slope of 0.69, showing less overestimation and underestimation through the adjustment of the initial field. The optimization of WRF- Chem_BC was much more evident than that of WRF- Chem_DA compared with the control experiment since the overestimation of the model was adjusted and the overall scatter distributions were more concentrated. However, there still existed an overall underestimation trend, with a slope of 0.73 after BC, which may not be sufficient for the simulation of strong pollution processes. It can be seen from Fig. 6a and 6d that the results of WRF- Chem_DA_BC were greatly improved by combining the two optimization methods, with the fitted slope of 1.04 being close to the straight line of  $k = 1$ . In this experiment, the  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  predictions were well adjusted and almost all of the high pollution could be captured, showing the best agreement with the observations. Overall, through adjustment of the model input field and correction of the model output, the predictions were effectively improved. It should be noted that the slope values in the control experiment and WRF- Chem_DA are close to those of previous results (Feng et al., 2018; Ma et al., 2024)."

It is evident that all three experiments were able to improve the  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  predictions in terms of their RMSEs compared with the control experiment. The variations of the RMSE values produced by WRF- Chem and WRF- Chem_DA were similar to those in the results of previous studies (Hong et al., 2022; Peng et al., 2018a; Peng et al., 2018b; Ma et al., 2024). Both BC and DA reduced the  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  prediction RMSEs throughout the entire 24- h forecasting period, with reductions of  $17.89 - 33.61\\mu \\mathrm{g} / \\mathrm{m}^3$  and  $13.27 - 21.82\\mu \\mathrm{g} / \\mathrm{m}^3$ , respectively. During the first  $0 - 10\\mathrm{h}$ , the optimization effects of DA and BC were similar, but then BC started to perform better during 10- 24 h due to the timeliness of the DA in the initial field, which has also been reported in previous research (Jiang et al., 2013; Ma et al., 2024). Since the optimization of BC was not sensitive to time, the improvement effects could then be maintained, with a normalized RMSE of 0.54 to 0.70, during the 0- 24- h forecasting period. Comparatively, WRF- Chem_DA_BC produced more accurate  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  predictions than WRF- Chem_DA and WRF- Chem_BC during the first 24- h period, with an RMSE reduction of 23.52 to  $35.95\\mu \\mathrm{g} / \\mathrm{m}^3$  owing to the adjustment of the initial field for the model input and the correction of the output at the same time to achieve a double optimization. Overall, despite the positive effects on  $\\mathrm{PM}_{2.5}$  predictions, the optimization achieved by the different experiments varied; specifically, WRF- Chem_DA_BC was best, followed by WRF- Chem_BC, and then finally WRF- Chem_DA. The error values of predictions produced by WRF- Chem and WRF- Chem_DA were close to some previous DA results in China (Peng et al., 2018a; Peng et al., 2018b; Ma et al., 2024)."

Therefore, these absorbing BB aerosols (BBAs) can essentially affect radiation balance (2, 3), cloud formation and properties (4, 5), precipitation (6, 7), and regional circulation patterns (8, 9). To better understand these impacts, recent flight campaigns have paid particular attention to the BBA over tropical regions where large amounts of BBA are injected into the atmosphere every year (10- 13)."

It is similar to the methodology applied in a previous study (31), in which we analyze AOD and considered all aerosols instead of carbonaceous aerosols only. Briefly, we linearly regressed modeled MAC against modeled SSA and modeled  $\\tau$  against modeled precipitation and the angstrom exponent (AE; an indicator of ambient particle size) using the model data from the AeroCom (Aerosol Comparisons between Observations and Models; see table S1) project. Then, we applied satellite observations of SSA to estimate the constrained MAC and similarly constrain  $\\tau$  from observations of precipitation and AE. Last, we used Eq. 1 to constrain  $E$  The constrained values of  $E,\\tau ,$  and MAC allow us to attribute AAOD errors to contributions from these three factors for individual models. Uncertainty analysis is conducted for all these constraining processes as shown in Fig. 1. Notably, the constrained results are only effective on a regional and seasonal scale, and caution must be exercised when directly applying these results to smaller scales. This work presents advancements upon the foundation of (31) as it constrains MAC instead of MEC (mass extinction coefficient). In addition, we implement in situ data in the interpretation of satellite observations that allows a disaggregation of BC and OC emissions. Furthermore, in our seasonal, regional analysis, we find that SOA formation is important for fire aerosols over the Amazon but not over Africa."

This suggests that the modeled relationship between MAC and SSA in AeroCom is robust. We then combine satellite observation of SSA with the linear relationship to constrain the MAC."

The two global models produce the most absorbing (ECHAM-HAM) and most scattering aerosols (SPRINTARS) in the AeroCom model ensemble (see fig. S6). The target variables include AAOD, AOD, and SSA. The normalized mean bias for AAOD and AOD and the mean bias of SSA (doubled to match axis scale) are shown for the whole fire season. Two configurations are considered for each model, including the default (bars with solid edges) and corrected simulations (bars without solid edges) based on constrained aerosol properties. Details of the model settings can be found in Materials and Methods and table S2. All the model data are collocated and validated with POLDER-GRASP. The vertical solid lines indicate the observation uncertainties of AAOD, AOD, and SSA for POLDER-GRASP. The observation uncertainty is calculated as the average of the absolute errors for POLDER-GRASP compared with AERONET sites, as shown in fig. S1. The POLDER-GRASP and AERONET datasets are collocated with each other before calculating these observation uncertainties."

To characterize satellite errors, we consider three datasets: the Polarization and Directionality of the Earth's Reflectances with the Generalized Retrieval of Aerosol and Surface Properties (POLDER- GRASP) algorithm, the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) with UV aerosol algorithm (OMAERUV), and the Advanced Along- Track Scanning Radiometer with Optimal Retrieval of Aerosol and Cloud algorithm (AATSR- ORAC). We validate the three datasets against AERONET data (the locations of the AERONET sites used in this study are shown in fig. S1) following the procedure in (47) and find that POLDER- GRASP exhibits the lowest error and has the highest correlations with AERONET data for both AAOD and SSA (fig. S16). Therefore, we use POLDER- GRASP as the satellite observation (including AE) during 2010 fire seasons throughout the analysis. However, even for POLDER- GRASP, large retrieval errors exist, which contribute substantially to the overall uncertainties presented in this work."

    "paragraph_info": "The overall constraining procedure is displayed in Fig. 1. The basic idea is to decompose AAOD into three interpretable factors: emission, lifetime, and MAC (see Eq. 1). The emission is calculated as the total of the BC and OA emissions; lifetime is calculated as the (burden of  $\\mathrm{BC + OA}$ )/emission of  $\\mathrm{BC + OA}$ , and MAC is AAOD/(burden of  $\\mathrm{BC + OA}$ ). All the variables are calculated as regional fire- season averages. Other absorbing components (e.g., dust) are assumed to have negligible impacts given the small contribution indicated by the observations (50) and AeroCom models (4%) for the two regions. In addition, we find a small absorption AE from POLDER- GRASP observations (fig. S19), suggesting that brown carbon is not important (51, 52). Note that the emission in Eq. 1 includes both primary emissions and those from secondary formation (SOA), as the latter happens on a much smaller time scale than the seasonal average that we are working with."

Here, we do not use the modeled relationship between rBC and SSA, as we find that it contains a large error (see fig. S6). It should be noted that the relationship by (24) was established under the criteria that OA and BC accounted for more than  $85\\%$  of the total aerosol mass (to focus on BBAs). For the AeroCom models, we compare the SSA for total aerosols and the SSA of grid cells with  $\\geq 85\\%$  carbonaceous aerosol components, with small differences being found for most models, especially within the range of the SSA observations (see fig. S20A). This suggests that the SSA for total aerosols during fire seasons could sufficiently represent the aerosol criteria by (24), which allows us to constrain the rBC in the ambient aerosols from SSA on the basis of the observed relationship. Using another regression to link the rBC from ambient aerosols to the emissions (see fig. S20B), we lastly obtain the constrained rBC in emissions and estimate the separate emissions for BC and OA."

    "paragraph_info": "Abstract- In geo- related fields such as urban informatics, atmospheric science, and geography, large- scale spatial time (ST) series (i.e., geo- referred time series) are collected for monitoring and understanding important spatiotemporal phenomena. ST series visualization is an effective means of understanding the data and reviewing spatiotemporal phenomena, which is a prerequisite for in- depth data analysis. However, visualizing these series is challenging due to their large scales, inherent dynamics, and spatiotemporal nature. In this study, we introduce the notion of patterns of evolution in ST series. Each evolution pattern is characterized by 1) a set of ST series that are close in space and 2) a time period when the trends of these ST series are correlated. We then leverage Storyline techniques by considering an analogy between evolution patterns and sessions, and finally design a novel visualization called GeoChron, which is capable of visualizing large- scale ST series in an evolution pattern- aware and narrative- preserving manner. GeoChron includes a mining framework to extract evolution patterns and two- level visualizations to enhance its visual scalability. We evaluate GeoChron with two case studies, an informal user study, an ablation study, parameter analysis, and running time analysis."

For the first challenge, GeoChron includes a carefully- designed data mining framework. The framework slices the time span and captures reliable correlation relations between ST series in each time slice. Afterward, it employs a network formulation to fuse the correlation relations above and the spatial proximity in a semantic- preserving way and detect communities as evolution patterns. Consequently, the Storyline layout algorithm can be applied by considering each ST series as an entity and considering an evolution pattern as a session. For the second challenge, GeoChron supports a novel two- level visualization mechanism to present the spatiotemporal information of large- scale ST series. At the first level, we revise the Storyline with new interactions and visual encodings, and link it with a geographic map, to present evolution patterns from a high level of perspective. At the second level, we employ an EvoLens, a lens placed on the Storyline, to display more details regarding the temporal trends of evolution patterns in a narrative- preserving manner.

Relation networks thereby can be constructed quickly after receiving the parameters. The Louvain algorithm is supported by the package slnetwork. All parameters are default, as they worked well in our multiple trials (See Sec. 8). We also employ a parallel framework Multiprocessing to detect communities for multiple time slices simultaneously. The frontend is implemented with TypeScript. It provides interactive visualizations for users. The Storyline is rendered on HTML5 canvas rather than HTML5 svg for efficiency."

Each cell is of uniform size and sufficiently small. For example, the geographic space in Figure 2A is divided into a  $3\\times 3$  grid with 9 cells. Second, we divide the ST series with  $T$  timestamps by their timestamps into  $T$  slices. For the  $t$ -th slice of the  $t$  timestamp,  $t\\leq T$ , there are observed data samples  $Z_{t} = {z_{1,t},z_{2,t},\\ldots ,z_{ST}}$ , with  $z_{i,t} = v_{i,t}$  representing the value of the  $i$ -th series at timestamp  $t$ . Afterwards, interpolation techniques, like Kriging and Inverse Distance Weighted, can be employed to predict  $\\hat{z}{c{x,y}}$  for each grid  $c_{x,y}\\in C$  based on observed data samples  $Z_{t}$ , generating a sample  $(s = (x,y),t,v = \\hat{z}{c{x,y}})$  in the spacetime volume. For each slice of each timestamp, we obtain a 2D scalar field with  $n\\times m$  cells. After performing the above operations for every slice, we stack the 2D scalar fields to form a completed space-time volume.\n2) Smoothing: Each generated 2D scalar field is smooth over the geographic space because of the spatial autocorrelation principle.

Assuming we are visualizing the ST series of air pollution concentration, below are some examples: If a voxel cluster extends significantly in the vertical direction and over the x- y plane, it indicates that the duration of poor air quality persists across a vast spatial area (Figure 3A①). If in a vertical cylindrical area in 3D cube space are voxel clusters with equal spacing, the air pollution exhibits periodicity at that location (Figure 3A②). If the voxel cluster exhibits shifts in 3D cube space, it indicates a process of air pollution propagation (Figure 3B and C)."

While numerous methods, such as 2D map- based estimations or coordinated 2D maps and line charts, are available for comparison, these approaches differ fundamentally in design and interaction principles from STC- based methods. We selected Thakur and Hanson's STC- based method [14] as the baseline, shown in Figure 1. This method, the most recent STC- based visualization for ST series, lacks volumetric representation but serves as a representative of similar methods [15], [16]. Its design allows a focused evaluation of the benefits introduced by volume- based visualization."

Note that regardless of which system you use, the order in which the questions appear is the same. When the subjects were conducting the experiment, the questions were displayed on a tablet. Once the subject confirmed understanding the question, the subject used the system on the desktop for analysis. The response time was recorded from the moment of the confirmation to the moment the answer was provided. During the experiment, a think- aloud protocol is employed, encouraging subjects to verbalize their thoughts."
