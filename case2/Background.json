    "paragraph_info": "Abstractâ€” The spatial time series generated by city sensors allow us to observe urban phenomena like environmental pollution and traffic congestion at an unprecedented scale. However, recovering causal relations from these observations to explain the sources of urban phenomena remains a challenging task because these causal relations tend to be time- varying and demand proper time series partitioning for effective analyses. The prior approaches extract one causal graph given long- time observations, which cannot be directly applied to capturing, interpreting, and validating dynamic urban causality. This paper presents Compass, a novel visual analytics approach for in- depth analyses of the dynamic causality in urban time series. To develop Compass, we identify and address three challenges: detecting urban causality, interpreting dynamic causal relations, and unveiling suspicious causal relations. First, multiple causal graphs over time among urban time series are obtained with a causal detection framework extended from the Granger causality test. Then, a dynamic causal graph visualization is designed to reveal the time- varying causal relations across these causal graphs and facilitate the exploration of the graphs along the time. Finally, a tailored multi- dimensional visualization is developed to support the identification of spurious causal relations, thereby improving the reliability of causal analyses. The effectiveness of Compass is evaluated with two case studies conducted on the real- world urban datasets, including the air pollution and traffic speed datasets, and positive feedback was received from domain experts."

In Beck et al.'s hierarchical taxonomy [6], juxtaposed node- link diagrams [11] are the most suitable for our problem. We have created an alternative design using juxtaposed node- link diagrams (Fig. 7a- 1). However, all edges are connected to the red node (i.e., the ego sensor), causing visual clutter. The variations of the causal directions cannot be easily revealed. We have also created an alternative (Fig. 7a- 2). Each row represents a neighbor sensor or its causal relations with the ego sensor. Each rectangle is divided into two parts to indicate the opposite directions. Although the causal relations are revealed without clutter, the spatial structures are still lost. We enhance this design and derive our final design (Fig. 1c) by using the compass glyphs and adding the heatmaps and the minimaps."

For example, a river can be polluted by its upstream tributaries. Compass can help identify when the river is polluted and reveal which tributaries pollute it for each period when the pollution events are observed.

Throughout the initial 24- h period, compared with the control experiment, the results of WRF- Chem_DA_BC (WRF- Chem_DA, WRF- Chem_BC) showed an improvement in terms of root- mean- square error, with reduction proportions varying from 38.90% to 48.86% (18.88% to 32.44%, 30.10% to 46.08%). Besides having the best optimization effect over the whole domain, the combined method also performed well in different regions: during the forecasting period of 0â€“24 h, the RMSEs decreased from 32% to 62%, 39% to 57%, 28% to 40%, and 30% to 49% in the Beijing- Tianjin- Hebei, Yangtze River Delta, Central China, and Sichuan Basin urban agglomerations, respectively."

    "paragraph_info": "BC is a statistical method that improves model predictions by establishing a relationship between historical observations and the corresponding model forecasts, from which the forecast bias can be extracted and the systematic errors corrected. With the advancements made in this line of research, BC methods have been developed from the earlier complete forecast method (Klein et al., 1959) to the model output statistical method (Glahn and Lowry, 1972), and then gradually evolved into different BC schemes. Frequency matching, Bayesian averaging, least- squares regression, multiple linear regression, and other statistical methods have been used to establish BC models, which significantly reduce systematic errors by learning the empirical relationships between historical forecasts and observations to realize BC (Raftery et al., 2005; Zhu and Luo, 2015; Xie et al., 2012; Chen et al., 2012; You, 2014). Recently, artificial- intelligence machine- learning techniques have emerged. Subsequently, BC based on machine- learning methods has been shown to better express the auxiliary links between various facets of the atmosphere, including, for instance, the different elements involved in atmospheric chemistry and key basic meteorological variables such as temperature and winds (Marzban, 2003; Zhang et al., 2022). Machine- learning models have been used in the BC of model outputs to improve  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  forecasts. For example, Ran et al. (2023) performed BC based on a multiple linear regression modeling approach to reduce the global  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  prediction bias; and Liu and Xing (2022a), Liu and Xing (2022b) designed a fully connected deep neural network to correct the  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  concentration bias in the outputs of chemical models, achieving better results than without the correction method applied. Ma et al. (2020) applied a time series model to correct  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  forecasts, which achieved good results. Different machine- learning methods were utilized by Li et al. (2021) as bias adjustment for postprocessing forecasts of  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  and  $\\mathrm{O}_3$ , showing the optimal approach to be the Random Forest model. Lu et al. (2020) utilized machine- learning methods to improve the accuracy of  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  forecasts through WRF- Chem in the Chengdu- Chongqing region. Overall, machine- learning methods have shown strong advantages in mining nonlinear relationships, enabling them to perform well in the BC of numerical predictions. However, they usually require massive, multi- source data inputs, which can limit their applicability in specific scenarios."

    "paragraph_info": "BC is a statistical method that improves model predictions by establishing a relationship between historical observations and the corresponding model forecasts, from which the forecast bias can be extracted and the systematic errors corrected. With the advancements made in this line of research, BC methods have been developed from the earlier complete forecast method (Klein et al., 1959) to the model output statistical method (Glahn and Lowry, 1972), and then gradually evolved into different BC schemes. Frequency matching, Bayesian averaging, least- squares regression, multiple linear regression, and other statistical methods have been used to establish BC models, which significantly reduce systematic errors by learning the empirical relationships between historical forecasts and observations to realize BC (Raftery et al., 2005; Zhu and Luo, 2015; Xie et al., 2012; Chen et al., 2012; You, 2014). Recently, artificial- intelligence machine- learning techniques have emerged. Subsequently, BC based on machine- learning methods has been shown to better express the auxiliary links between various facets of the atmosphere, including, for instance, the different elements involved in atmospheric chemistry and key basic meteorological variables such as temperature and winds (Marzban, 2003; Zhang et al., 2022). Machine- learning models have been used in the BC of model outputs to improve  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  forecasts. For example, Ran et al. (2023) performed BC based on a multiple linear regression modeling approach to reduce the global  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  prediction bias; and Liu and Xing (2022a), Liu and Xing (2022b) designed a fully connected deep neural network to correct the  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  concentration bias in the outputs of chemical models, achieving better results than without the correction method applied. Ma et al. (2020) applied a time series model to correct  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  forecasts, which achieved good results. Different machine- learning methods were utilized by Li et al. (2021) as bias adjustment for postprocessing forecasts of  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  and  $\\mathrm{O}_3$ , showing the optimal approach to be the Random Forest model. Lu et al. (2020) utilized machine- learning methods to improve the accuracy of  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  forecasts through WRF- Chem in the Chengdu- Chongqing region. Overall, machine- learning methods have shown strong advantages in mining nonlinear relationships, enabling them to perform well in the BC of numerical predictions. However, they usually require massive, multi- source data inputs, which can limit their applicability in specific scenarios."

GSI 3DVAR is almost the same as traditional 3D variational methods, which are based on the idea of variational DA. However, it shows advantages in its ability to deal with observations that have complex nonlinear relationships with atmospheric state model variables, thus making it possible to assimilate observations with nonlinear relations to atmospheric state quantities. In order to improve aerosol predictions, an aerosol assimilation module was integrated systematically into the GSI 3DVAR system (Pagowski et al., 2014). In this paper, the DA of the initial field is based on the GSI system at 00:00 UTC each day. The GSI system is fitted to the observation and model background field by minimizing the objective function, and the analytical field is the optimal solution for the minimal value of the objective function in equation (1)."

From the scatter fitting analysis results, WRF- Chem_DA_BC performed best in its consistency with observations following optimization. The results predicted directly by WRF- Chem in the control experiment were dispersed, with some isolated overestimation and underestimation scatter points fitted along the slope of 0.56, which demonstrates poor ability in simulating the high- pollution zones. By applying DA, the predictions of WRF- Chem_DA were partially improved, with an increased fitting slope of 0.69, showing less overestimation and underestimation through the adjustment of the initial field. The optimization of WRF- Chem_BC was much more evident than that of WRF- Chem_DA compared with the control experiment since the overestimation of the model was adjusted and the overall scatter distributions were more concentrated. However, there still existed an overall underestimation trend, with a slope of 0.73 after BC, which may not be sufficient for the simulation of strong pollution processes. It can be seen from Fig. 6a and 6d that the results of WRF- Chem_DA_BC were greatly improved by combining the two optimization methods, with the fitted slope of 1.04 being close to the straight line of  $k = 1$ . In this experiment, the  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  predictions were well adjusted and almost all of the high pollution could be captured, showing the best agreement with the observations. Overall, through adjustment of the model input field and correction of the model output, the predictions were effectively improved. It should be noted that the slope values in the control experiment and WRF- Chem_DA are close to those of previous results (Feng et al., 2018; Ma et al., 2024)."

Assessments of these impacts rely heavily on the modeled aerosol absorption from poorly constrained global models and thus exhibit large uncertainties. By combining the AeroCom model ensemble with satellite and in situ observations, we provide constraints on the aerosol absorption optical depth (AAOD) over the Amazon and Africa. Our approach enables identification of error contributions from emission, lifetime, and MAC (mass absorption coefficient) per model, with MAC and emission dominating the AAOD errors over Amazon and Africa, respectively. In addition to primary emissions, our analysis suggests substantial formation of secondary organic aerosols over the Amazon but not over Africa. Furthermore, we find that differences in direct aerosol radiative effects between models decrease by threefold over the BB source and outflow regions after correcting the identified errors. This highlights the potential to greatly reduce the uncertainty in the most uncertain radiative forcing agent."

However, models have shown substantial discrepancies and errors regarding BBA absorption (16- 19), which remains a key obstacle to reliable climate assessments because BBA absorption can simultaneously contribute to direct, semidirect, and indirect aerosol effects (9, 20). Comparisons between models and satellite observations suggest that global models generally underestimate the overall warming impacts of BBA, as indicated by a substantial underestimation of the aerosol absorption optical depth (AAOD) (21) in combination with an overestimation of the single- scattering albedo (SSA) (20). These findings are supported by flight campaign measurements (22, 23) such as the ObseRvations of Aerosols above CLOUDs and their intEractionS (ORACLES) project (22), suggesting that the overall warming caused by BBA plumes is greater than previously considered, particularly in tropical regions. However, when considering the aerosol composition, global models tend to produce stronger absorption than observed from field and laboratory measurements for a given BC mass mixing ratio (24). The contradiction between the underestimated overall warming and overestimated absorbing capability per unit of BC mass highlights important errors in the emission, composition, and optical properties of absorbing BBA. Although there have been discussions regarding the possible reasons for these model errors [e.g., particle size distribution, vertical profiles, mixing states, and refractive index (24- 28)], a quantitative evaluation of how these factors contribute to the overall errors is still missing. This poses a fundamental challenge to the aerosol modeling community, which hinders reliable climate assessments over tropical regions."

These findings are supported by flight campaign measurements (22, 23) such as the ObseRvations of Aerosols above CLOUDs and their intEractionS (ORACLES) project (22), suggesting that the overall warming caused by BBA plumes is greater than previously considered, particularly in tropical regions. However, when considering the aerosol composition, global models tend to produce stronger absorption than observed from field and laboratory measurements for a given BC mass mixing ratio (24). The contradiction between the underestimated overall warming and overestimated absorbing capability per unit of BC mass highlights important errors in the emission, composition, and optical properties of absorbing BBA. Although there have been discussions regarding the possible reasons for these model errors [e.g., particle size distribution, vertical profiles, mixing states, and refractive index (24- 28)], a quantitative evaluation of how these factors contribute to the overall errors is still missing.

With default configurations, the differences in modeled SSA and direct radiative effects between two models are likely associated with the very different particle size distribution and refractive index, the two factors that affect SSA the most in the AeroCom models (text S1).

For ECHAM-HAM, we increase the emitted/ambient particle size by referring to our previous study (31). In SPRINTARS, we switch off the hygroscopic growth for OA which is likely too strong (57). Modifications to both models produce better agreement with the AE observations from POLDER-GRASP (fig. S22A). The AE bias in the default simulations and the corresponding improvement through corrections are further supported by AERONET observations (fig. S22B).\n2) Refractive index for BC. According to field measurements (58, 59), the imaginary part of refractive index of BC in the two models is changed to  $0.3i$ . Note that this value is lower than those used in the AeroCom models (0.44 to 0.79 for the imaginary part; see table S1). We conduct a sensitivity test on the imaginary part ranging from 0.1 to 0.5 with the corrected ECHAM-HAM model and find that the modified particle size with a value of 0.3 agrees the best with SSA observations from (24), suggesting that the observation-based refractive index is more suitable than those used in the AeroCom models (see fig. S23). In addition to SSA, this correction also results in better agreement with our constrained MAC for the two models (fig. S24). This refractive index is also used in a previous model study (60). Moreover, we also test different real parts of refractive index by changing values from 1.4 to 1.95 encompassing both observed values (61) and model-recommended values (see table S1). The resulting changes in AAOD are negligible  $(< 1\\%)$  and we maintain the default model values.\n3) Precipitation. A scaling factor is directly added to the modeled wet deposition based on the default precipitation error. This will correct the lifetime together with the modified particle size as stated above.\n4) Emissions. BC and total OA emissions (both primary emissions and those from secondary formation) are scaled to our constrained results."

Originally, the Storyline was designed to visualize the dynamic relationships between entities and applied to reveal the development of a story, movie, or meeting. For example, Liu et al.'s Storyline [30] depicts characters' or entities' interaction in the same scene over time in a movie. Each entity is represented as a curve along a horizontal timeline. Curves are bundled together to form a session only if the entities are related to each other in the period. By drawing an analogy (Fig. 2) between an evolution pattern and a session (or an ST series and an entity), the Storyline can present evolution patterns over time in a well- organized way and thereby visualize large- scale ST series. However, two challenges must be addressed to apply the Storyline technique to visualize large- scale ST series:"

However, correlated ST series are sometimes not necessarily similar by values (e.g., Fig. 6E) but should have similar trends. To reveal their correlative trends, we design a trend motif (Fig. 6F). We denote the subpart of an ST series in a line chart as a sub- ST series. For a line chart, we respectively normalize each sub- ST series there according to its max and min values. For each time stamp in the line chart, we have a set of values, each of which is from a normalized sub- ST series. Afterward, we obtain the lower quartile  $q_{n}(0.25)$ , median, and upper quartile  $q_{n}(0.75)$  for these values. Finally, the lower and upper quartiles in all time stamps are visualized with an area. The medians in all time stamps form a median line. The line is superimposed with the area, constituting a trend motif. Via the trend motif, the correlative trends of multiple ST series can be revealed in circumstances where the ST series are dissimilar in values from each other. For example, the trend motif of Fig. 6F clearly shows an upward trend of the ST series in Fig. 6E."

GeoChron enables users to view and analyze large- scale ST series intuitively, which is important in many scenarios, such as data review and real- time monitoring. Initial hypotheses regarding the evolution of spatiotemporal phenomena can also be established. Second, the pattern mining framework is justified as the evolution patterns presented in the cases have correlated trends of spatially close ST series. Third, the Storyline has a readable layout, which shows the heuristic positioning is acceptable."

Their readings had correlatively increased and reached a high level of air pollution within the first three days (Fig. 1E and F). Afterward (Day 4), the purple and green ST series became uncorrelated as the purple ST ones continuously increased while the green ones fluctuated. They separated into left and right regions (Fig. 1D4). Second, the black ST series were less correlated with others and the readings did not rise very high (Fig. 1E1). It might be because of the sea breeze blowing from three sides blew away air pollution quickly. Finally, the red ST series experienced a decrease on the third day, followed by an increase during the final three days, whereas the other ST series remained on a downward trend (Fig. 1E and F). A hypothesis suggests that during the last three days, an additional pollution source may have polluted the BTH region. Testing the hypotheses requires additional data and in- depth analysis [10, 13]."

Afterward, the orange ST series separated into another session because they had a subtle drop during the period of Fig. 6D1. As a result, the orange ST series reached a high level of air pollution one day later than the purple one. In the last three days (Days 3, 4, and 5 in Fig. 6C), the orange and purple ST series had slightly different trends and both exhibited subtle declines around 4 pm each day, indicated by the red dashed line in Fig. 6D. The above observations implied that there might be propagation processes of air pollution from north to south in the first two/three days. Afterwards, the air in both regions was filled with air pollutants. The fluctuation/decline trends in the orange and purple ST series were different since the industrial structure and pollution purification capabilities of the two regions were different. We consulted historical weather data, and at that time Yangtze River Delta did receive strong cold air from the north, which caused blizzards and brought massive air pollutants."

Each time series  $\\nu^{x,y}$ ,  $1 \\leq x \\leq m$ ,  $1 \\leq y \\leq n$ , is in ST series at the cell  $c_{x,y}$  with  $T$  timestamps.

The average response time for questions Q9 and Q10 was at least 7 seconds shorter when using VolumeSTCube than when using the baseline. For Q4 and Q9, the Wilcoxon test on the response times of using the two systems results in  $p = 0.03$  (significance) and  $p = 0.06$  (weak significance), respectively.

Furthermore, to improve the STC's adaptability to large-scale datasets, we design interactions for users to manipulate the STC from time and space dimensions, corresponding to spatial and temporal selection interactions common in 2D views. In the case study, the expert comprehensively analyzed an quality in China, demonstrating VolumeSTCube's effectiveness. The user study employed carefully designed tasks that required participants to utilize both volume and surface visualizations, alongside interactions such as volume spotlight, slicing, and voxel cluster-based techniques, to complete the analyses. The high accuracy and efficiency observed in task completion indicate that participants mastered VolumeSTCube, further underscoring its usability, effectiveness, and broad applicability."

Given the inherent uncertainty in the interpolation process, uncertainty visualizations are desirable for reliable analysis, helping assess whether observed patterns are uncertain and if local but important patterns are being overlooked [63]. In the future, we plan to incorporate uncertainty into VolumeSTCube, using methods such as the uncertain volume visualization technique."

In particular, we transform large- scale ST series into volumetric data that is subsequently visualized with volume and surface rendering. To enhance users' ability to explore the visualization, we design user- friendly interactions oriented to spatial, temporal, and spatiotemporal patterns of ST series. VolumeSTCube is evaluated with a computation experiment, a real- world case study, and a controlled within- subject user study."
