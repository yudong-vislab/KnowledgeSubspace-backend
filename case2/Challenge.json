However, recovering causal relations from these observations to explain the sources of urban phenomena remains a challenging task because these causal relations tend to be time- varying and demand proper time series partitioning for effective analyses. The prior approaches extract one causal graph given long- time observations, which cannot be directly applied to capturing, interpreting, and validating dynamic urban causality. This paper presents Compass, a novel visual analytics approach for in- depth analyses of the dynamic causality in urban time series. To develop Compass, we identify and address three challenges: detecting urban causality, interpreting dynamic causal relations, and unveiling suspicious causal relations. First, multiple causal graphs over time among urban time series are obtained with a causal detection framework extended from the Granger causality test. Then, a dynamic causal graph visualization is designed to reveal the time- varying causal relations across these causal graphs and facilitate the exploration of the graphs along the time. Finally, a tailored multi- dimensional visualization is developed to support the identification of spurious causal relations, thereby improving the reliability of causal analyses. The effectiveness of Compass is evaluated with two case studies conducted on the real- world urban datasets, including the air pollution and traffic speed datasets, and positive feedback was received from domain experts."

Although causal detection models can summarize these causal relations across a whole time span, the detected static results can be rough (partially correct) or even incorrect and provide limited insights into precise and reliable policymaking (Fig. 2b and 2c). No interactive systems are available for interpreting and validating the detected causality in an urban context, which makes the causality unreliable and cannot be fully utilized (Fig. 2d)."

Numerous causal relations can be displayed. The values of each dimension can be seen in the parallel axes. The first type of suspicious relations can be indicated by the gray lines passing the top of the distance axis (Fig. 7b- 2). Built on the PCP, we adopt scatterplots to visualize the dimensions related to the same causal direction (Fig. 6d).

Although ego graph- like causal graphs support an effective analysis for the target area, causal analyses can be enhanced with more complex causal graphs, such as by involving the relations between neighbor sensors. However, analyzing the complex graphs in a spatiotemporal context is challenging. For example, visual clutter is hard to avoid because the geo- fixed nodes make the causal graph layout methods inapplicable [65,76]. It also becomes difficult to clearly reveal the temporal variations of the detected causalities as the number of edges increases. Utilizing the third dimension can be a potential solution [5, 14, 62, 80] and deserves further study. Secondly, due to the lack of multi- source datasets in the same temporal and spatial scope, the effectiveness of our method in cross- domain causal analysis has not been proven. In fact, causality may exist between different urban datasets. For example, as the traffic volume increases, the air quality will deteriorate because cars emit exhaust gas and pollute the air [83]. In the future, we will collect richer datasets and conduct studies, thereby evaluating and improving our approaches. Finally, we found that when the number of links to be tested in all time windows is more than 150, the calculation time exceeds ten seconds. In the future, we will optimize the detection model, implement it with a more high- performance programming language, and deploy it to a distributed computing server."

However, due to the considerable uncertainties and model assumptions related to pollutant emissions, meteorological conditions, and chemical reaction mechanisms, the frameworks and parameterization schemes of these models are still imperfect, which may bring errors in their forecasts (Van Loon et al., 2007; Zhu et al., 2018; Lv et al., 2018)."

Assessments of these impacts rely heavily on the modeled aerosol absorption from poorly constrained global models and thus exhibit large uncertainties. By combining the AeroCom model ensemble with satellite and in situ observations, we provide constraints on the aerosol absorption optical depth (AAOD) over the Amazon and Africa. Our approach enables identification of error contributions from emission, lifetime, and MAC (mass absorption coefficient) per model, with MAC and emission dominating the AAOD errors over Amazon and Africa, respectively. In addition to primary emissions, our analysis suggests substantial formation of secondary organic aerosols over the Amazon but not over Africa. Furthermore, we find that differences in direct aerosol radiative effects between models decrease by threefold over the BB source and outflow regions after correcting the identified errors. This highlights the potential to greatly reduce the uncertainty in the most uncertain radiative forcing agent."

To achieve this goal, we use the linear relationship observed by (24) between rBC and SSA to estimate ambient rBC from satellite observations of SSA. AeroCom models allow us to establish a relationship between ambient and emitted rBC, which, in any case, is close to identical (see Materials and Methods). These constrained BC and OA emissions can be compared with four widely used inventories of BC and OC emissions [i.e., Global Fire Emission Database version 4.1s (GFED), Global Fire Assimilation System version 1.2 (GFAS), Fire Energetics and Emission Research version 1.2 (FEER), and Quick Fire Emissions Dataset version 2.5 (QFED)], providing that we have reasonable OA/OC ratios (Fig. 4). Field measurements of primary BBA emissions exhibit a narrow range (1.5 to 1.9) for OA/OC (33- 39). We find that most inventories estimate lower emissions than our estimates over Africa, which partly explains the negative AAOD bias (Fig. 3B), as these inventories are used in AeroCom models (table S1)."

ST series visualization is an effective means of understanding the data and reviewing spatiotemporal phenomena, which is a prerequisite for in- depth data analysis. However, visualizing these series is challenging due to their large scales, inherent dynamics, and spatiotemporal nature. In this study, we introduce the notion of patterns of evolution in ST series. Each evolution pattern is characterized by 1) a set of ST series that are close in space and 2) a time period when the trends of these ST series are correlated. We then leverage Storyline techniques by considering an analogy between evolution patterns and sessions, and finally design a novel visualization called GeoChron, which is capable of visualizing large- scale ST series in an evolution pattern- aware and narrative- preserving manner. GeoChron includes a mining framework to extract evolution patterns and two- level visualizations to enhance its visual scalability. We evaluate GeoChron with two case studies, an informal user study, an ablation study, parameter analysis, and running time analysis."

These visualizations are then either plotted on a map by their geographic positions [54, 65], or displayed in a separate view that is coordinated with a map [43], and thereby can be related back to the geographic context. The above methods, considered as the strategy of direct depiction [37], are not effective for large- scale ST series. An analyst may find it difficult to browse the spatial distribution in the vast space and diverse, dynamically changing trends over a long time to gain insights (e.g., trends, correlation, and anomalies). Another strategy is to transform ST series by summarizing them into summaries [19,42] (e.g., variations of consecutive records [24]) or by extracting patterns from them [10, 13] (e.g., co- occurrence patterns [23]). These summaries or patterns, rather than massive raw ST series, are then visually exposed. Yet, the trend narrative and dynamics of ST series, the fundamental features of ST series data, are broken into summaries [19] or patterns [9, 23]. Neither patterns nor summaries are depicted over time. Analysts cannot intuitively perceive how the recorded phenomena develop in the geographic space over time. For example, how quickly does air quality in an area deteriorate/improve? How long is the time before it deteriorates again? Is the deteriorating area expanding?"

Originally, the Storyline was designed to visualize the dynamic relationships between entities and applied to reveal the development of a story, movie, or meeting. For example, Liu et al.'s Storyline [30] depicts characters' or entities' interaction in the same scene over time in a movie. Each entity is represented as a curve along a horizontal timeline. Curves are bundled together to form a session only if the entities are related to each other in the period. By drawing an analogy (Fig. 2) between an evolution pattern and a session (or an ST series and an entity), the Storyline can present evolution patterns over time in a well- organized way and thereby visualize large- scale ST series. However, two challenges must be addressed to apply the Storyline technique to visualize large- scale ST series:"

Despite many advanced methodologies, the seamless integration of temporal and spatial information remains a challenge. The space- time cube (STC) stands out as a promising approach for the synergistic presentation of spatial and temporal information, with successful applications across various spatiotemporal datasets. However, the STC is plagued by well- known issues such as visual occlusion and depth ambiguity, which are further exacerbated when dealing with large- scale spatial time series data. In this study, we introduce a novel technical framework termed VolumeSTCube, designed for continuous spatiotemporal phenomena. It first leverages the concept of the STC to transform discretely distributed spatial time series data into continuously volumetric data. Subsequently, volume rendering and surface rendering techniques are employed to visualize the transformed volumetric data. Volume rendering is utilized to mitigate visual occlusion, while surface rendering provides pattern details by enhanced lighting information. Lastly, we design interactions to facilitate the exploration and analysis from temporal, spatial, and spatiotemporal perspectives. VolumeSTCube is evaluated through a computational experiment, a real- world case study with one expert, and a controlled user study with twelve non- experts, compared against a baseline from prior work, showing its superiority and effectiveness in large- scale spatial time series analysis."

Visualization is an effective and popular means for analyzing ST series, as it can present heterogeneous spatial and temporal information through easily perceivable and interactive graphics. With the advancement of sensor technology, the scale of ST series data has become increasingly large. By large- scale, we refer to datasets containing millions of records, following previous studies [1], [2]. For example, China's air quality ST series spans an entire year with thousands of timestamps and covers the entire country with hundreds of ST series [3], resulting in millions of records.

In contrast, an integrated view tightly organizes the spatial and temporal visualizations to reduce such costs. The spacetime cube (STC) [6] is a kind of integrated view in a three- dimensional space, in which the space naturally occupies two dimensions (i.e., x- y plane), and the time constitutes the third dimension (i.e., z- axis). The position of the visual graphics can be directly related to both space and time dimensions. It is easy for users to accept and learn, and thus, users can perceive time and space simultaneously [7].

Due to the limited number of sensors and their limited monitoring capabilities, the recorded ST series of these phenomena exhibit discreteness in the time and space domains. Targeting such a kind of ST series, we propose VolumeSTCube towards better visualization of large- scale ST series. It first transforms the discrete ST series data into continuous space- time volumetric data following the strategy of the space- time cube. Afterward, the volume- based visualization is designed and then equipped with a set of flexible interactions. The combination of the space- time cube and 3D volume visualization effectively presents large- scale ST series with less context switching cost and visual occlusion."

To do that, PA adjusted the map and the upper plane and specified a three day (from March 26 to March 29) time range during which air pollution occurred in vast areas. Figure  $6\\mathrm{F}2①$  was the top view for this time range. Due to the dust storm, a large region of northern China suffered from moderate to above- average pollution.

Subjects can easily compare the size and color of each voxel cluster, and thereby identify the largest one. Conversely, subjects using the baseline method found it challenging to compare hotspots due to occlusion, especially in densely clustered columns in North China, as shown in Figure 1. They resorted to selecting time ranges and columns to estimate the largest hotspot, which was time- consuming and imprecise. Consequently, the baseline takes 8 seconds longer on average than VolumeSTCube. Furthermore, with the baseline method, one subject gave up, and two subjects provided incorrect answers, resulting in an accuracy rate of  $75\\%$ , which is lower than VolumeSTCube's accuracy rate of  $100\\%$ ."
