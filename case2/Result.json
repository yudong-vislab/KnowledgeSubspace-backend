    "paragraph_info": "Abstractâ€” The spatial time series generated by city sensors allow us to observe urban phenomena like environmental pollution and traffic congestion at an unprecedented scale. However, recovering causal relations from these observations to explain the sources of urban phenomena remains a challenging task because these causal relations tend to be time- varying and demand proper time series partitioning for effective analyses. The prior approaches extract one causal graph given long- time observations, which cannot be directly applied to capturing, interpreting, and validating dynamic urban causality. This paper presents Compass, a novel visual analytics approach for in- depth analyses of the dynamic causality in urban time series. To develop Compass, we identify and address three challenges: detecting urban causality, interpreting dynamic causal relations, and unveiling suspicious causal relations. First, multiple causal graphs over time among urban time series are obtained with a causal detection framework extended from the Granger causality test. Then, a dynamic causal graph visualization is designed to reveal the time- varying causal relations across these causal graphs and facilitate the exploration of the graphs along the time. Finally, a tailored multi- dimensional visualization is developed to support the identification of spurious causal relations, thereby improving the reliability of causal analyses. The effectiveness of Compass is evaluated with two case studies conducted on the real- world urban datasets, including the air pollution and traffic speed datasets, and positive feedback was received from domain experts."

Based on the requirements, we further develop Compass, a visual analytics system for the causal analysis of urban time series. Compass addresses the aforementioned three challenges as follows. For the first challenge, we propose a causal detection framework by extending the Granger causality test. This framework includes neighbor index, time partition, and debounce strategies to improve the capability of the causality test for urban time series. For the second challenge, we design a dynamic graph visualization to reveal the temporal variation of the detected causal relations and enable time- oriented drill- down analyses of causal graphs. For the third challenge, we consider the multiple dimensions of causal relations and propose a tailored visualization to expose causality suspiciousness. Finally, two real- world case studies on air pollution and traffic speed datasets, respectively, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. In sum, our contributions are as follows:"

In a revisited compass glyph, arrows still convey the causal directions within a spatial context. The glyph is revised to incorporate the temporal information as follows. The arrow's size encodes the frequency of the causal links with this direction. An offset between the two opposite arrows can be observed if bi- directional relations exist.

Various visualizations have been proposed for this kind of data. Such as dimension reduction [68,88], scatterplot matrix [49], parallel coordinate plot (PCP) [10] and glyphs [82]. This view should satisfy two requirements, showing details and revealing suspiciousness. We have created two alternatives after exploring the design space. The first one is the spreadsheet that is commonly seen as a detail view (Fig. 7b- 1). However, it cannot handle many relations. The second one is the PCP (Fig. 7b- 2) better than the spreadsheet. Numerous causal relations can be displayed. The values of each dimension can be seen in the parallel axes. The first type of suspicious relations can be indicated by the gray lines passing the top of the distance axis (Fig. 7b- 2). Built on the PCP, we adopt scatterplots to visualize the dimensions related to the same causal direction (Fig. 6d). Scatterplots allow another suspiciousness metric, the Pearson's  $r$ , to be encoded using the size that can be accurately perceived. Besides, scatterplots are more familiar to the experts than the PCP."

After hovering over this band, the map view displayed the spatial causal graph (Fig. 1a- 1). However, some involved causal links were suspicious because they had low correlation coefficients indicated by the circle sizes in the relation view (Fig. 1d- 2). Given that, the experts unfolded this graph band to verify the causalities (Fig. 1c- 2). The orders in which the peaks appear in the two time series supported the causal directions detected by the model. The time differences of the peaks were also consistent with the lags. EB said, \"although the time series were not highly correlated, the model captured the key features, i.e., the peaks, and obtained reasonable causalities.\""

A causal detection framework and temporal visualizations are combined to unveil these dynamic causalities.

The static causal graphs detected by the previous methods will ignore these time- varying cause- effect relationships and thus cannot support accurate and informed decisions.

This observation supports other researchers' opinion [31, 76] that human knowledge needs to be integrated into the analysis loop for reliable analyses."

Other potential applications include analyzing noise pollution [9], water pollution [1], and complex physical systems (e.g., IoT systems of tree ecosystem services [46]). For example, a river can be polluted by its upstream tributaries. Compass can help identify when the river is polluted and reveal which tributaries pollute it for each period when the pollution events are observed. In terms of visual analytics, Compass can be regarded as a model- free visual analytics approach and is not limited to the Granger causality test. Granger causality test is currently the most suitable method for our problem because of its wide use, interpretability, and ability to detect causality based on short partitioned time series. However, some recognized issues of the Granger causality test still exist. For example, it is a linear model [27]. Any better model proposed in the future can be easily integrated into our visual analytics system."

(2012) used three different assimilation methods with MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) AOD (aerosol optical depth) products and in situ  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  observations, and the results showed that all three methods improved the forecasting of aerosols. Song et al. (2021) used the 3DVAR (three- dimensional variational) approach to jointly assimilate meteorological data and in situ observations to improve the prediction of  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$ . Hong et al. (2022) assimilated in situ observations and satellite data simultaneously to further improve  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  predictions. And in another study, different kinds of data were used in the assimilation of the initial field to analyze the enhancement of  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  forecasts by different assimilation sources (Ma et al., 2024). These previous studies have shown that DA can improve  $\\mathrm{PM}_{2.5}$  predictions by adjusting the initial state of the atmospheric chemistry, but the improvement of the prediction is limited, and the effect of assimilation gradually disappears with long- term integration of the simulation (Ma et al., 2024; Ma et al., 2020; Hong et al., 2022). In addition, the model prediction errors are not only affected by the uncertainty of the initial field, but also various other uncertainties such as those of the meteorological field and the physicochemical reactions (Zhu et al., 2018). Numerical model BC comprehensively considers the systematic errors of the model forecast to improve the forecast accuracy. Different from DA, which is the adjustment of the initial field from the model input perspective, BC is the post- processing of model outputs from the back end of the model, and can to a certain extent make up for the limitations of initial field DA."

With the advancements made in this line of research, BC methods have been developed from the earlier complete forecast method (Klein et al., 1959) to the model output statistical method (Glahn and Lowry, 1972), and then gradually evolved into different BC schemes. Frequency matching, Bayesian averaging, least- squares regression, multiple linear regression, and other statistical methods have been used to establish BC models, which significantly reduce systematic errors by learning the empirical relationships between historical forecasts and observations to realize BC (Raftery et al., 2005; Zhu and Luo, 2015; Xie et al., 2012; Chen et al., 2012; You, 2014). Recently, artificial- intelligence machine- learning techniques have emerged.

With the advancements made in this line of research, BC methods have been developed from the earlier complete forecast method (Klein et al., 1959) to the model output statistical method (Glahn and Lowry, 1972), and then gradually evolved into different BC schemes. Frequency matching, Bayesian averaging, least- squares regression, multiple linear regression, and other statistical methods have been used to establish BC models, which significantly reduce systematic errors by learning the empirical relationships between historical forecasts and observations to realize BC (Raftery et al., 2005; Zhu and Luo, 2015; Xie et al., 2012; Chen et al., 2012; You, 2014). Recently, artificial- intelligence machine- learning techniques have emerged. Subsequently, BC based on machine- learning methods has been shown to better express the auxiliary links between various facets of the atmosphere, including, for instance, the different elements involved in atmospheric chemistry and key basic meteorological variables such as temperature and winds (Marzban, 2003; Zhang et al., 2022). Machine- learning models have been used in the BC of model outputs to improve  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  forecasts. For example, Ran et al. (2023) performed BC based on a multiple linear regression modeling approach to reduce the global  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  prediction bias; and Liu and Xing (2022a), Liu and Xing (2022b) designed a fully connected deep neural network to correct the  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  concentration bias in the outputs of chemical models, achieving better results than without the correction method applied. Ma et al. (2020) applied a time series model to correct  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  forecasts, which achieved good results. Different machine- learning methods were utilized by Li et al.

(2020) utilized machine- learning methods to improve the accuracy of  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  forecasts through WRF- Chem in the Chengdu- Chongqing region. Overall, machine- learning methods have shown strong advantages in mining nonlinear relationships, enabling them to perform well in the BC of numerical predictions.

Both methods can improve the accuracy level of pollutant forecasting to a certain extent. Although both methods can improve the forecast accuracy of the model from the perspective of data statistics, previous studies have tended to analyze the enhancement of model forecasts by the two methods independently, with few studies having compared the enhancement effects of these two methods together. In addition, the effect of combining DA on the initial conditions and BC on the optimization of the model forecast has not been studied."

MDS- UNet shows advantages in multiscale feature learning due to its multiscale convolution module, as compared with the traditional UNet. The single convolution kernel in the traditional model can only catch some of the features of the pollutants with a fixed scale. However, pollution characteristics vary on different spatial scales and multiscale convolution adopts a hierarchical structure with different spatial sizes of convolution kernels to extract the multiscale features by learning feature maps from the image.

This performance whereby WRF- Chem always underestimates  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  concentrations over northern areas in China is a common problem, caused by not simulating secondary aerosols or the transformation mechanisms with their gaseous precursors (Ma, 2020; Wei et al., 2022; Qin et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2016). The prediction MB values were reduced by the DA and BC methods, but BC had better effects in terms of prediction improvement. Consistent with the results shown in Fig. 3, despite the adjustment to the original overestimation by DA in WRF- Chem_DA over some regions of SCB and CC, the prediction MB values could still reach  $60\\mu \\mathrm{g} / \\mathrm{m}^3$  in some areas, thus demonstrating some advantages of DA, but with limitations. Compared with the direct predictions of WRF- Chem, the prediction MB values in the WRF- Chem_BC experiment were reduced over most areas due to BC effects. It is worth noting that the original overestimation changed to an underestimation in the WRF- Chem_BC experiment over some regions of YRD and the Shandong Peninsula, which indicated overcorrection by BC. For WRF- Chem_DA_BC, the prediction MB was the smallest among all the experiments, with values less than  $20\\mu \\mathrm{g} / \\mathrm{m}^3$  over most areas. WRF- Chem_DA_BC showed a smaller prediction MB than WRF- Chem_BC, especially over the Shandong Peninsula and YRD regions."

The results predicted directly by WRF- Chem in the control experiment were dispersed, with some isolated overestimation and underestimation scatter points fitted along the slope of 0.56, which demonstrates poor ability in simulating the high- pollution zones. By applying DA, the predictions of WRF- Chem_DA were partially improved, with an increased fitting slope of 0.69, showing less overestimation and underestimation through the adjustment of the initial field. The optimization of WRF- Chem_BC was much more evident than that of WRF- Chem_DA compared with the control experiment since the overestimation of the model was adjusted and the overall scatter distributions were more concentrated. However, there still existed an overall underestimation trend, with a slope of 0.73 after BC, which may not be sufficient for the simulation of strong pollution processes. It can be seen from Fig. 6a and 6d that the results of WRF- Chem_DA_BC were greatly improved by combining the two optimization methods, with the fitted slope of 1.04 being close to the straight line of  $k = 1$ . In this experiment, the  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  predictions were well adjusted and almost all of the high pollution could be captured, showing the best agreement with the observations.

However, models have shown substantial discrepancies and errors regarding BBA absorption (16- 19), which remains a key obstacle to reliable climate assessments because BBA absorption can simultaneously contribute to direct, semidirect, and indirect aerosol effects (9, 20). Comparisons between models and satellite observations suggest that global models generally underestimate the overall warming impacts of BBA, as indicated by a substantial underestimation of the aerosol absorption optical depth (AAOD) (21) in combination with an overestimation of the single- scattering albedo (SSA) (20). These findings are supported by flight campaign measurements (22, 23) such as the ObseRvations of Aerosols above CLOUDs and their intEractionS (ORACLES) project (22), suggesting that the overall warming caused by BBA plumes is greater than previously considered, particularly in tropical regions. However, when considering the aerosol composition, global models tend to produce stronger absorption than observed from field and laboratory measurements for a given BC mass mixing ratio (24). The contradiction between the underestimated overall warming and overestimated absorbing capability per unit of BC mass highlights important errors in the emission, composition, and optical properties of absorbing BBA. Although there have been discussions regarding the possible reasons for these model errors [e.g., particle size distribution, vertical profiles, mixing states, and refractive index (24- 28)], a quantitative evaluation of how these factors contribute to the overall errors is still missing. This poses a fundamental challenge to the aerosol modeling community, which hinders reliable climate assessments over tropical regions."

    "paragraph_info": "Although the above analysis highlights the errors in total emissions, it can provide more valuable insights if the total emissions can be speciated into either BC or OA emissions with a constrained rBC [i.e.,  $\\mathrm{BC:(\\bar{B}C + OA)}$ ]. To achieve this goal, we use the linear relationship observed by (24) between rBC and SSA to estimate ambient rBC from satellite observations of SSA. AeroCom models allow us to establish a relationship between ambient and emitted rBC, which, in any case, is close to identical (see Materials and Methods). These constrained BC and OA emissions can be compared with four widely used inventories of BC and OC emissions [i.e., Global Fire Emission Database version 4.1s (GFED), Global Fire Assimilation System version 1.2 (GFAS), Fire Energetics and Emission Research version 1.2 (FEER), and Quick Fire Emissions Dataset version 2.5 (QFED)], providing that we have reasonable OA/OC ratios (Fig. 4). Field measurements of primary BBA emissions exhibit a narrow range (1.5 to 1.9) for OA/OC (33- 39). We find that most inventories estimate lower emissions than our estimates over Africa, which partly explains the negative AAOD bias (Fig. 3B), as these inventories are used in AeroCom models (table S1)."

The ECHAM- HAM [a model developed from the atmospheric model by European Center for Medium- Range Weather Forecasts (EC) and a parameterization package developed at Hamburg (HAM)] and SPRINTARS (Spectral Radiation- Transport Model for Aerosol Species) models are selected given their opposite SSA errors in the AeroCom ensemble (fig.

However, it is worth noting that this retrieval uncertainty is generally smaller than the default errors in the model. As shown in Fig. 5, our corrections over the BBA source regions in both models have reduced the seasonal AAOD error, especially in the ECHAM- HAM model. Although the SPRINTARS AAOD error has slightly increased following the corrections, it remains comparable to the uncertainty associated with satellite retrievals. The SSA is also found to better agree with satellite observations, suggesting the robustness of our analysis and corrections. In addition, the modeled AOD exhibits much smaller errors, which independently verifies our analysis. Moreover, our corrections over the source regions also benefit the simulations in the outflow areas, with smaller errors found for AAOD, AOD, and SSA in the two models (figs. S10 and S11).

Our work rigorously considers uncertainties in these observations. In particular, the satellite- derived aerosol absorption retrieval errors contribute the most to the overall uncertainty in this study (fig. S15), even when using the most reliable satellite products. This suggests that the impending improvement of satellite products will greatly reduce the uncertainty and promote the utility of our method."

To characterize satellite errors, we consider three datasets: the Polarization and Directionality of the Earth's Reflectances with the Generalized Retrieval of Aerosol and Surface Properties (POLDER- GRASP) algorithm, the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) with UV aerosol algorithm (OMAERUV), and the Advanced Along- Track Scanning Radiometer with Optimal Retrieval of Aerosol and Cloud algorithm (AATSR- ORAC). We validate the three datasets against AERONET data (the locations of the AERONET sites used in this study are shown in fig. S1) following the procedure in (47) and find that POLDER- GRASP exhibits the lowest error and has the highest correlations with AERONET data for both AAOD and SSA (fig. S16). Therefore, we use POLDER- GRASP as the satellite observation (including AE) during 2010 fire seasons throughout the analysis. However, even for POLDER- GRASP, large retrieval errors exist, which contribute substantially to the overall uncertainties presented in this work."

With default configurations, the differences in modeled SSA and direct radiative effects between two models are likely associated with the very different particle size distribution and refractive index, the two factors that affect SSA the most in the AeroCom models (text S1).

Such an assumption is supported by the substantial model improvement after correction for 2009 (fig. S25). This compelling result underscores the robustness of our methodology, as it is independent of the specific year of model data chosen for analysis."

We develop a data mining framework to extract evolution patterns (i.e., sessions) from large- scale ST series. We design a two- level visualization mechanism based on the classic Storyline representation to support effective visual analysis of large- scale ST series in a spatiotemporal context. We demonstrate the successful application of GeoChron through two real- world cases, which expands Storyline's impact to the field of big spatiotemporal data analysis."

The main reason is that when two aligned entities are straightened, the straightening process pushes other sessions up or down entirely over many time slices (Fig. 4A), consuming much vertical space. StoryFlow's solution [30] also has this issue. To alleviate this issue, we discard those session pairs whose number of entities in common is less than a threshold  $th_{c}$ .

We denote the subpart of an ST series in a line chart as a sub- ST series. For a line chart, we respectively normalize each sub- ST series there according to its max and min values. For each time stamp in the line chart, we have a set of values, each of which is from a normalized sub- ST series. Afterward, we obtain the lower quartile  $q_{n}(0.25)$ , median, and upper quartile  $q_{n}(0.75)$  for these values. Finally, the lower and upper quartiles in all time stamps are visualized with an area. The medians in all time stamps form a median line. The line is superimposed with the area, constituting a trend motif. Via the trend motif, the correlative trends of multiple ST series can be revealed in circumstances where the ST series are dissimilar in values from each other. For example, the trend motif of Fig. 6F clearly shows an upward trend of the ST series in Fig. 6E."

For task 3, all participants made descriptions similar to the case presented in Sec. 8.1.1. In particular, they all noticed 1) a small decline in the orange ST series on the first day (Fig. 6D1), 2) a rise in the orange ST series a day after the rise in the purple ST series, and 3) the medium/high level all ST series reached on the third day (Day 3 in Fig. 6C). It can be seen that all participants, even P6, did understand GeoChron's visualizations."

We obtain different layouts generated under different combinations of  $th_s$  and  $th_c$ . Then, we use the average height of all time slices to quantify each layout's height (Fig. 10A). The layout is high when these two parameters are small (e.g., Fig. 10F). Users may have difficulty browsing the visualization. Increasing the two parameters can compact the layout. They work by different principles. On the one hand, in creasing  $th_c$  results in the layout with looser alignment (e.g., Fig. 10G). Users can still analyze those sessions with small sizes. On the other hand, increasing  $th_s$  results in the layout of Fig. 5A or D, where fewer sessions are displayed (Fig. 10B)."

    "paragraph_info": "Abstract- Spatial time series visualization offers scientific research pathways and analytical decision- making tools across various spatiotemporal domains. Despite many advanced methodologies, the seamless integration of temporal and spatial information remains a challenge. The space- time cube (STC) stands out as a promising approach for the synergistic presentation of spatial and temporal information, with successful applications across various spatiotemporal datasets. However, the STC is plagued by well- known issues such as visual occlusion and depth ambiguity, which are further exacerbated when dealing with large- scale spatial time series data. In this study, we introduce a novel technical framework termed VolumeSTCube, designed for continuous spatiotemporal phenomena. It first leverages the concept of the STC to transform discretely distributed spatial time series data into continuously volumetric data. Subsequently, volume rendering and surface rendering techniques are employed to visualize the transformed volumetric data. Volume rendering is utilized to mitigate visual occlusion, while surface rendering provides pattern details by enhanced lighting information. Lastly, we design interactions to facilitate the exploration and analysis from temporal, spatial, and spatiotemporal perspectives. VolumeSTCube is evaluated through a computational experiment, a real- world case study with one expert, and a controlled user study with twelve non- experts, compared against a baseline from prior work, showing its superiority and effectiveness in large- scale spatial time series analysis."

The higher the value, the worse the air quality. In the data transformation procedure, the parameters of the Gaussian model are automatically determined by the PyKridge library. We evaluated the accuracy of the adopted Kriging interpolation on the dataset and found it to be acceptable, ensuring the reliability of subsequent analyses.
