        "paragraph_info": "form. The temperature, humidity, raining of different areas are dissimilar and the wind speed, wind direction make air pollution varies from locations to locations. Another critical reason for air pollution is traffic density and traffic congestion. The area with more traffic volume or frequent traffic jam will have ambient air quality worse. One indication of the traffic jam is the average driving speed on each road, in which a low average speed means there might be traffic congestion. The air quality monitoring stations could help us to have a measurement of air pollution at and around their located points but not for the whole city. For example, in Seoul, only less than 40 monitoring stations are covering the area of 600 km2. Consequently, we need to interpolate and predict air pollution in areas that do not have observation stations nearby. While we can not build air quality monitoring stations for all regions in a city, we can use aforementioned air pollution impact factors collected for other locations throughout the city to interpolate and forecast air pollution in the citywide scale. In fig. 1, we show the overall picture for our addressing research which tries to solve the air pollution interpolation and prediction for the entire city based on many air pollution related sources. In the next section, we will introduce the collected spatiotemporal datasets, specific to Seoul city in Korea, to help build better air pollution prediction models.",

Air pollution consists of a mixture of particulate matter (i.e. PM2.5 and PM10) and gaseous species (i.e. NO<sub>2</sub>, CO, O<sub>3</sub> and SO<sub>2</sub>), which have both acute and chronic effects on human health, especially for young and elderly [2]. From statistical results [3], Beijing recorded 46 days of heavy pollution during 2015, accounting for 12.6 percent of the year. For monitoring real-time air pollution, Chinese governments have built many air quality monitoring stations and published air quality data every hour in recent years [4]. Besides monitoring, there is a rising demand for predicting future air quality, which can inform governments' policy-making (such as performing traffic control when the air is polluted seriously) and people's decision making (like whether to exercise outdoors).",

Then, we use a classic spatial interpolation method, inverse distance weighting (IDW) [11], to interpolate the AQI of fake monitoring stations. Considering the readings of geospatially adjacent stations located in both inside and outside the outer circle, IDW assigns a weight to each available reading of geospatially adjacent stations by the distance to target sensor, and then aggregates these weights and readings by weighted average. After that, we aggregate the interpolated values of fake stations to calculate average AQI for the region. Finally, we get 17 AQI in one timestamp which 1 AQI come from target station and 16 AQI come from neighbor regions. We conduct the same process for each monitoring stations along time.",

        "paragraph_info": "As shown in Figure 5(a), air quality monitoring stations (marked as dot) are randomly scattered in geographical space, where color on the dot means the level of air quality. Firstly, we partition the geographical space into 16 regions by four lines and two circles, e.g. 20 km and 100 km semidiameter. As depicted in Figure 5(b), all regions share the target monitoring station (denoted by the black point) as common center and regions in the inner circle have a small area, while regions in the outer circle have a big area. Also, regions with different angles fit eight wind directions, which may be further captured by meteorological conditions. Furthermore, we aggregate the readings of air quality recorded by monitoring stations within the regions, illustrated in Figure 5(c). As a result, regions with at least one station will have one average AQI. However, from the partition results of Beijing, we find that different target stations have different missing patterns and about 33% regions do not have monitoring stations. Thus, we fill the missing values in these regions shown in Figure 5(d). More specifically, we first random generate some fake monitoring stations in these regions.

As Beijing has the most complicated air quality, we focus on Beijing's data when comparing with different baselines, while showing overall results for the other eight cities. Table 2 details the statistical results about Beijing dataset. To predict the air quality of 36 monitoring stations in Beijing, 74 neighbor stations within 100km (semidiameter) to Beijing are retrieved. Among all air quality records, 2.3% cases are sudden changes. In the experiments, the data in the first 24 months is used for training, and the data in last 12 months is used for testing.",

In general, DeepAir can achieve an average accuracy of (81.1%, 63%, 46%) in (1-6h, 7-48h, sudden changes) for all cities. Comparing with FFA, our approach has a better performance in all nine cities, with 2.4%,  $12.2\\%,\\ 63.2\\%$  relative accuracy improvements on short-term, long-term and sudden changes prediction. The reason behind it is that FFA trains four separate prediction models for modeling influential features respectively, which may fail to capture the interactions among all factors. Also, FFA is a shallow method which cannot capture the underlying complex pattern of each factor. Moreover, the features in FFA is not strong enough as it ignores the dynamic change of weather forecasts.",

Recently, Wang et al. adapted a sequential fusion architecture, which fuses two features firstly, then fuses some new features in the same manner iteratively in a sequence [22]. However, sequential fusion need design the order of fusion sequence, which costs lots of time for tuning. Our DeepAir adapts a distributed fusion architecture to learn the feature interactions by enhancing main feature interacting with auxiliary features respectively, which is derived from domain knowledge as each indirect factor will have an individual effect on direct factors affecting future air quality.",

Currently, no uniform theory or mechanism can elucidate NPF occurrence in different polluted areas or in different seasons. For example, in Shanghai and Beijing (China), sulfuric acid (SA, H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) and amines have been identified as key contributors to initial particle formation (Yao et al., 2018; Cai et al., 2021; Yan et al., 2021). On the other hand, some studies have also suggested that photooxidation products of vehicle-emitted organic vapors dominate NPF under urban conditions, rather than SA or basic species (Guo et al., 2020).

The HFDMPS significantly improves sub-10 nm particle measurements compared with a typical differential mobility particle sizer (DMPS) system, allowing us to better characterize the sub-10 nm particle size distribution when combined with the PSM measurements. The DMA was size-calibrated with electro-sprayed positively charged monomer ions of tetraheptylammonium bromide (THA+; Ude and de la Mora, 2005).",

This difference in the observed NPF frequency was likely due to the different season with favorable conditions for NPF, such as a potentially lower CS (due to less stagnant meteorological conditions) and higher alkaline- and organic-molecule concentrations in summer. In addition, the abundant solar radiation and low aerosol water content (limiting surface area and heterogenous reactions; Du et al., 2022) likely create favorable conditions for NPF to occur.",

The solid lines are from fitted results of CLOUD chamber experiments; the black hexagons represent the median values under different SA levels from the ambient measurement. (b) The relationship between the sulfuric acid dimer (SA dimer) concentration, the square of monomer (SA)<sup>2</sup> concentrations and the CS. The lines are from the kinetic model simulations under different DMA levels, whereas the dots are from the measurement. In panels (a) and (b), the results from the field measurements are from the daytime (10:00\u201314:00 LT) and are color-coded by the temperature at the site. The J1.7 and corresponding SA concentrations of CLOUD chamber results are from previous literature (Xiao et al., 2021). (c) Calculated growth rates for 1.5\u20133, 3\u20137 and 7\u201315 nm from this study and values reported by Kontkanen et al. (2016, yellow squares). The red horizontal lines are the median values, the blue boxes show the values between the 25th and 75th percentiles, and the black whiskers mark the 5th and 95th percentiles.

The values in parentheses represent the respective 25th and 75th percentiles of data (Fig. 3c). Growth rates increase with particle diameter, which is a phenomenon also observed in other campaigns around the world (Kontkanen et al., 2017; Kulmala et al., 2013), typically indicative of an increasing organic vapor contribution with size (e.g., Stolzenburg et al., 2018). The growth rates observed here were similar to those observed by Kontkanen et al. (2016) at SPC in summer (7.2 nm  $h^{-1}$  for 7\u201320 nm). Moreover, our 1.5\u2013 3 nm growth rate matches well with Manninen et al. (2010)  $(1.5 \\text{ nm h}^{-1})$  during spring in the Po Valley. A comparison to predicted growth rates from sulfuric acid condensation without organics, which was calculated based on kinetic collisions of the measured SA concentrations and the effect of van der Waals forces on the collision frequency (Stolzenburg et al., 2020), suggests that sulfuric acid condensation may be, on average, sufficient for the growth of the smallest clusters (Fig. 3c). This supports the argument that sulfuric acid and its stabilizing molecules (likely the bases, such as  $NH_3$  and amines) were controlling particle formation in the initial steps of NPF and growth in the Po Valley. However, for particles to grow beyond 3 nm in size, other vapors were needed, which was suggested by the significantly lower contribution of growth by SA (indicated by the green line) than the measured GR for  $3-7$  and  $7-15$  nm particles (Fig. 3c). Those vapors were likely a mixture of organics from anthropogenic and biogenic origins (with the latter emitted at higher rates during summer). We compared the GR during NPF with and without growth events using the method proposed in Kulmala et al.  $(2022)$ : the signal was averaged for all classified non-event days and an appearance time fit was then performed for each size channel independently, also revealing a growth pattern. We found no significant difference with respect to the GR in the  $7-15 \\text{ nm}$  size range for NPF with or without growth days ( $\\text{GR} = 5.1 \\text{ nm h}^{-1}$  for NPF with growth days and  $GR = 6.1 \\text{ nm h}^{-1}$  for NPF without growth days). Considering the similar CS and GR levels for NPF with and without growth days, the higher formation rates at  $1.7 \\text{ nm}$  ( $87 \\text{ cm}^{-3} \\text{ s}^{-1}$ ) may be a more important factor to surpass the CS. Under stable meteorological conditions, a higher formation rate may significantly elevate the possibility that newly formed particles overcome the CS and continuously grow to larger sizes.",

The growth rates observed here were similar to those observed by Kontkanen et al. (2016) at SPC in summer (7.2 nm  $h^{-1}$  for 7\u201320 nm).

A comparison to predicted growth rates from sulfuric acid condensation without organics, which was calculated based on kinetic collisions of the measured SA concentrations and the effect of van der Waals forces on the collision frequency (Stolzenburg et al., 2020), suggests that sulfuric acid condensation may be, on average, sufficient for the growth of the smallest clusters (Fig. 3c). This supports the argument that sulfuric acid and its stabilizing molecules (likely the bases, such as  $NH_3$  and amines) were controlling particle formation in the initial steps of NPF and growth in the Po Valley. However, for particles to grow beyond 3 nm in size, other vapors were needed, which was suggested by the significantly lower contribution of growth by SA (indicated by the green line) than the measured GR for  $3-7$  and  $7-15$  nm particles (Fig. 3c). Those vapors were likely a mixture of organics from anthropogenic and biogenic origins (with the latter emitted at higher rates during summer). We compared the GR during NPF with and without growth events using the method proposed in Kulmala et al.  $(2022)$ : the signal was averaged for all classified non-event days and an appearance time fit was then performed for each size channel independently, also revealing a growth pattern. We found no significant difference with respect to the GR in the  $7-15 \\text{ nm}$  size range for NPF with or without growth days ( $\\text{GR} = 5.1 \\text{ nm h}^{-1}$  for NPF with growth days and  $GR = 6.1 \\text{ nm h}^{-1}$  for NPF without growth days). Considering the similar CS and GR levels for NPF with and without growth days, the higher formation rates at  $1.7 \\text{ nm}$  ( $87 \\text{ cm}^{-3} \\text{ s}^{-1}$ ) may be a more important factor to surpass the CS. Under stable meteorological conditions, a higher formation rate may significantly elevate the possibility that newly formed particles overcome the CS and continuously grow to larger sizes.",

At nighttime, the SA concentrations were close to zero due to the scavenging of  $SO_2$  and SA by the high RH (Fig. 1). During our sampling period, large amounts of organics were identified by the CI-APi-ToF. They were typically smaller than 400 Th with carbon numbers  $< 8$  and oxygen numbers  $< 6$  (Fig. S7). Due to the relatively high  $NO_x$  levels (13 ppb) that can terminate the dimerization reactions (Yan et al.,  $2020$ ), no OOM dimers were found, which is different from clean and biogenically dominated environments such as Hyyti\u00e4l\u00e4 (Lehtipalo et al., 2018). The compositions of OOMs were similar between NPF and non-NPF days, although with different abundance. Extremely high abundances of nitrophenols and their homologous compounds were found on non-NPF days ( $\\sim 8$  times higher than on NPF days), likely caused by both the enhanced primary, e.g., biomass burning (Mohr et al., 2013) and pesticide usage (Harrison et al., 2005), and secondary, e.g., photochemical and/or aqueous-phase secondary formation, sources (Zheng et al., 2021; Gilardoni et al., 2016).  $C_{2-4}H_{4.5}N_{0.1}O_{3.4}$  compounds were found to be 50 % higher (Fig. S7) on non-NPF days, likely caused by the enhanced heterogeneous reactions that form smaller organics, such as carboxylic acids, under higher-RH conditions. Previous studies have also reported aqueous-phase organic aerosol processing at high RH (Gilardoni et al., 2016) and high concentrations of carboxylic acids, such as formic, oxalic and malonic acids, in the springtime in the Po Valley (Saarikoski et al., 2012). In general, the fraction of the abundance of nitrogen-containing OOMs (CHON) with respect to the total identified OOMs was  $60\\%$ \u2013 $70\\%$ , which is close to the levels reported in polluted cities such as Nanjing (Nie et al., 2022) and Beijing (Guo et al., 2022). A slightly higher fraction of CHON compounds  $(73\\%)$  was found during non-NPF days than NPF days (67 %), consistent with higher  $NO_x$ and fine-particulate-matter levels (Fig. S8). This is likely associated with the stagnant meteorological conditions and the accumulation of pollutants during the non-NPF days. However, the overall high amounts of CHON compounds and the lack of organic dimers make it unlikely that OOMs drive the NPF process (both clustering and initial growth; see, e.g., Simon et al., 2020). Their similar abundance on non-NPF and NPF days was also in line with the similar estimated GR for both types of days.",

At nighttime, the SA concentrations were close to zero due to the scavenging of  $SO_2$  and SA by the high RH (Fig. 1). During our sampling period, large amounts of organics were identified by the CI-APi-ToF. They were typically smaller than 400 Th with carbon numbers  $< 8$  and oxygen numbers  $< 6$  (Fig. S7). Due to the relatively high  $NO_x$  levels (13 ppb) that can terminate the dimerization reactions (Yan et al.,  $2020$ ), no OOM dimers were found, which is different from clean and biogenically dominated environments such as Hyyti\u00e4l\u00e4 (Lehtipalo et al., 2018). The compositions of OOMs were similar between NPF and non-NPF days, although with different abundance. Extremely high abundances of nitrophenols and their homologous compounds were found on non-NPF days ( $\\sim 8$  times higher than on NPF days), likely caused by both the enhanced primary, e.g., biomass burning (Mohr et al., 2013) and pesticide usage (Harrison et al., 2005), and secondary, e.g., photochemical and/or aqueous-phase secondary formation, sources (Zheng et al., 2021; Gilardoni et al., 2016).  $C_{2-4}H_{4.5}N_{0.1}O_{3.4}$  compounds were found to be 50 % higher (Fig. S7) on non-NPF days, likely caused by the enhanced heterogeneous reactions that form smaller organics, such as carboxylic acids, under higher-RH conditions. Previous studies have also reported aqueous-phase organic aerosol processing at high RH (Gilardoni et al., 2016) and high concentrations of carboxylic acids, such as formic, oxalic and malonic acids, in the springtime in the Po Valley (Saarikoski et al., 2012). In general, the fraction of the abundance of nitrogen-containing OOMs (CHON) with respect to the total identified OOMs was  $60\\%$ \u2013 $70\\%$ , which is close to the levels reported in polluted cities such as Nanjing (Nie et al., 2022) and Beijing (Guo et al., 2022).

A slightly higher fraction of CHON compounds  $(73\\%)$  was found during non-NPF days than NPF days (67 %), consistent with higher  $NO_x$ and fine-particulate-matter levels (Fig. S8). This is likely associated with the stagnant meteorological conditions and the accumulation of pollutants during the non-NPF days. However, the overall high amounts of CHON compounds and the lack of organic dimers make it unlikely that OOMs drive the NPF process (both clustering and initial growth; see, e.g., Simon et al., 2020).

The variations in  $SO_2$  and SA concentrations in the Po Valley could possibly be attributed to differences in air masses, as indicated by the higher RH on non-NPF days (53 %) compared with NPF days  $(38\\%)$  but the similar temperature (NPF days:  $288\\,\\mathrm{K}$ ; non-NPF days: 287 K). On higher-RH days, photochemistry may be suppressed, potentially reducing the formation of sulfuric acid and low-volatility condensable vapors.",

        "paragraph_info": "In this study, we conducted a continuous 2-month measurement campaign in the Italian Po Valley during springtime, where frequent NPF events were observed on 66 % of all days. Through direct ion cluster measurement, kinetic models and comparison with the CLOUD chamber experiment, we have determined that sulfuric acid\u2013base nucleation is the dominant formation mechanism in the Po Valley region. Abundant sulfuric acid and alkaline molecules, including amines and ammonia derived from agriculture activities, provided ample precursors for NPF events. In contrast to megacity environments, the CS showed no significant difference between NPF event days and non-event days, indicating that it is more the abundance of precursors than the variations in the sink controlling the occurrence of NPF in the Po Valley. Furthermore, we observed that, apart from DMA, a typical basic precursor, NH<sup>3</sup> and other amines were also likely to be involved in NPF in the Po Valley. This was supported by the high abundance of SA\u2013NH<sup>3</sup> and SA\u2013NH3\u2013amine clusters measured by the APi-ToF during NPF events. DMA, while more efficient than ammonia, was insufficient to stabilize all SA during our sampling period. This resulted in a more scattered correlation between sulfuric acid concentrations and measured formation rates compared with Chinese megacities. In that sense, we could show that the clustering during NPF is clearly distinct between polluted megacity environments and polluted semi-urbanized regions such as the Po Valley. Similar to Beijing, we found that OOMs did not play a decisive role in initial cluster formation, likely due to the absence of ultra-low-volatility organics (typical OOM dimers) in the ion and neutral cluster measurements. However, low-volatility organics were abundant enough to induce fast growth processes above 3 nm. The comparable GRs and formation rates, along with the lower efficient CS compared with megacity environments, indicate a high survival probability for the newly formed particles. Therefore, NPF is likely to play an important role in the fine-particle concentrations and pollution levels in the Po Valley region. Further reductions in key NPF species, including SO2, amines and NH3, can contribute to suppressing the NPF event frequency and lowering particle numbers.

Abundant sulfuric acid and alkaline molecules, including amines and ammonia derived from agriculture activities, provided ample precursors for NPF events. In contrast to megacity environments, the CS showed no significant difference between NPF event days and non-event days, indicating that it is more the abundance of precursors than the variations in the sink controlling the occurrence of NPF in the Po Valley. Furthermore, we observed that, apart from DMA, a typical basic precursor, NH<sup>3</sup> and other amines were also likely to be involved in NPF in the Po Valley. This was supported by the high abundance of SA\u2013NH<sup>3</sup> and SA\u2013NH3\u2013amine clusters measured by the APi-ToF during NPF events. DMA, while more efficient than ammonia, was insufficient to stabilize all SA during our sampling period. This resulted in a more scattered correlation between sulfuric acid concentrations and measured formation rates compared with Chinese megacities. In that sense, we could show that the clustering during NPF is clearly distinct between polluted megacity environments and polluted semi-urbanized regions such as the Po Valley. Similar to Beijing, we found that OOMs did not play a decisive role in initial cluster formation, likely due to the absence of ultra-low-volatility organics (typical OOM dimers) in the ion and neutral cluster measurements. However, low-volatility organics were abundant enough to induce fast growth processes above 3 nm. The comparable GRs and formation rates, along with the lower efficient CS compared with megacity environments, indicate a high survival probability for the newly formed particles. Therefore, NPF is likely to play an important role in the fine-particle concentrations and pollution levels in the Po Valley region. Further reductions in key NPF species, including SO2, amines and NH3, can contribute to suppressing the NPF event frequency and lowering particle numbers. This, in turn, would improve air quality in the Po Valley region.",

These data enabled a quantitative source apportionment of ON using PMF receptor modeling. The PMF results allowed investigation of the diel variations in ON sources. Details regarding the PMF configuration and diagnostics are provided in Text S1 in the Supplement. Benefiting from the comprehensive array of molecular source tracers, the PMF analysis resolved a total of 18 factors, including eight primary emission sources and 10 secondary formation sources. The factor profiles and contributions are displayed in Figs. S3 and S4 in the Supplement, respectively. Source identification was based on established molecular and elemental markers (Qiao et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2015). These factors and their corresponding markers are as follows. (1) Industrial emissions were represented by manganese (Mn), iron (Fe), and zinc (Zn). (2) Coal combustion was identified through selenium (Se) and lead (Pb). (3) Biomass burning was characterized by the presence of levoglucosan, mannosan, and galactosan. (4) Vehicle emissions were indicated by hopanes, nitrogen oxides  $(NO_x)$ , and elemental carbon (EC). (5) Residue oil combustion was marked by high loadings of nickel (Ni). (6) Cooking emissions were indicated by saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. (7) Oxygenated cooking OA formation was characterized by the high loadings of azelaic acid, 9-oxononanoic acid, and nonanoic acid, which are oxidation products of oleic acid or other unsaturated fatty acids with  $-C = C$  at the C9 position that are emitted directly from cooking activities (Huang et al., 2021a; Wang and Yu, 2021). This factor reflects secondary oxidation products originating from primary cooking emissions and showed pronounced enhancements during dinner hours, as illustrated in Fig. S4a. (8) Sea salt emissions were distinguished by sodium  $(Na^+)$  and chloride  $(Cl^-)$ . (9) Soil dust was indicated by silicon (Si) and calcium (Ca). (10) Nitrocatechol formation processes were represented by 4-nitrocatechol, 3-",

Nitrocatechols are probably formed through the nitration of catechols emitted from biomass burning. This secondary formation pathway was supported by the good correlation between levoglucosan and nitrocatechols (Fig. S7). The contribution of primary cooking emissions to ON was generally low, averaging 2 % across the observation period. However, this contribution increased to 5 \u00b1 4 % (ranging from 0.8 % to 17 %) during dinner time (Fig. 2).",

        "paragraph_info": "The formation of ON compounds associated with oxygenated cooking OA probably involves the reactive uptake of N2O<sup>5</sup> / NO<sup>3</sup> radicals by unsaturated fatty acid particles, leading to the production of organic nitrates (Gross et al., 2009; Zhao et al., 2011). The combined contribution from the two cooking-related factors was particularly pronounced during dinnertime, reaching 17 \u00b1 10 %. It is noted that the study-wide average contributions to ON from cooking emission and their oxidation product factors were much lower at noon compared to evening (Fig. 2). This difference might be attributed to the lower cooking emissions and/or more favorable dispersion conditions during lunchtime.

We identified 17 such cases during the field observation period. Interestingly, DCA\\_ON showed a strong correlation with  $NH_4^+$  in all these cases (Fig. 3a). This result lends support for the hypothesis that DCA\\_ON may represent reduced ON species formed through the reactions between DCAs and  $NH_3 / NH_4^+$ . The slopes of linear regression between DCA\\_ON and  $NH_{4}^{+}$  varied largely among the cases and could be roughly divided into higher-slope cases and lower-slope cases, with 7 and 10 in these two categories, respectively (Fig. 3a). A higherslope value indicated a more rapid formation of DCA\\_ON at a given concentration level of  $NH_4^+$ . The higher-slope cases were distinctly associated with higher  $O_3$  concentration (Fig. 3b), suggesting an elevated oxidation capacity and hence enhanced formation of secondary products such as DCAs, which serve as the precursors of DCA\\_ON. This argument was supported by the overall higher increment of DCAs concentration in the higher-slope cases (Fig. 3b). Note that the aqueous formation of imines such as imidazoles through the reactions between carbonyls and  $NH_3 / NH_4^+$  has been established in laboratory studies (Galloway et al., 2009; Noziere et al., 2009) and confirmed by field observations (Zhang et al., 2020; Lian et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2023). Considering the close relationship between carbonyls and DCAs, the possibility that imines contributed to DCA\\_ON could not be excluded. Overall, while we acknowledge that a positive correlation with  $NH_4^+$  is not exclusive to DCA\\_ON, the combination of observational evidence described above and mechanistic plausibility strengthens our interpretation that the DCA-related ON probably contributes to reduced ON formation.",

This fraction of SON may indicate the formation of organic nitrates, which share common precursor of  $NO_x$  with nitrate. Organic nitrates have long been recognized as notable components of secondary OAs in ambient air (Rollins et al., 2012; Perring et al., 2013). Organic nitrate formation encompasses two main pathways: hydroxyl radical (OH)-initiated oxidation of hydrocarbons in the presence of  $NO_x$  during the day and nitrate radical ( $NO_3$ )-initiated oxidation of alkenes during the night. Both pathways involve the formation of organic nitrates in the gas phase, followed by partitioning to the particulate phase (Perring et al., 2013). This study, through integrated analyses of SON and SOC, provides evidence suggesting that organic nitrates might also form through heterogeneous or aqueous reactions. As depicted in Fig. 4, the nitrate formation process produced  $0.17 \\,\\mu\\text{g N m}^{-3}$  of  $\\Delta\\text{SON}$  and  $0.43 \\,\\mu\\text{g C m}^{-3}$  of  $\\Delta\\text{SOC}$  from the night of 20 December to the following morning, yielding a  $\\Delta$ SOC /  $\\Delta$ SON atomic ratio of only 2.9. Gas-phase formation of organic nitrates followed by gas-to-particle partitioning would not result in such a low  $C/N$  ratio. Therefore, a large number of organic nitrates might be formed through heterogeneous or aqueous reactions between organic compounds and  $\\text{HNO}_3 / \\text{NO}_3$ , enhancing the ON content while not affecting the OC content which is already present in the particle phase. In a previous study, it was suggested that organic nitrates can be produced through non-radical reactions of hydrated glyoxal and nitric acid in the aqueous phase (Lim et al., 2016). Xu et al. (2020) found that aerosol liquid water promotes the formation of water-soluble ON, probably in the form of organic nitrate species. Previous studies have identified an 80 % underestimation of monoterpene hydroxyl nitrate by the GEOS-Chem model, which considers both OH oxidation and  $NO_3$  oxidation mechanisms of monoterpene (Li et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2021), indicating an incomplete understanding of the formation mechanisms of organic nitrates. Our observational results, combined with previous investigations, suggest the need for further exploration of the formation mechanisms of particulate organic nitrates, such as heterogeneous/aqueous phase reaction processes.",

To find the causes of air pollution, the propagation processes of air pollutants must be studied at a large spatial scale. However, the complex and dynamic wind fields lead to highly uncertain pollutant transportation. The state-of-the-art data mining approaches cannot fully support the extensive analysis of such uncertain spatiotemporal propagation processes across multiple districts without the integration of domain knowledge. The limitation of these automated approaches motivates us to design and develop AirVis, a novel visual analytics system that assists domain experts in efficiently capturing and interpreting the uncertain propagation patterns of air pollution based on graph visualizations. Designing such a system poses three challenges: a) the extraction of propagation patterns; b) the scalability of pattern presentations; and c) the analysis of propagation processes. To address these challenges, we develop a novel pattern mining framework to model pollutant transportation and extract frequent propagation patterns efficiently from large-scale atmospheric data. Furthermore, we organize the extracted patterns hierarchically based on the minimum description length (MDL) principle and empower expert users to explore and analyze these patterns effectively on the basis of pattern topologies. We demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach through two case studies conducted with a real-world dataset and positive feedback from domain experts.",

Based on this concept, we follow a depth-first search procedure outlined as follows: starting from a random transportation graph, we recursively add the transportation graphs that are spatiotemporally continuous with the added ones to the propagation graph. To simulate the decomposition of air pollutants, we limit the maximum time span of the propagation graph to 200 hours, as recommended by the experts. By repeating this procedure, we are able to generate a massive number of propagation graphs  $pG = (V, E)$  until all the transportation graphs have been visited. The attributes associated with the nodes and edges in the propagation graphs are identical to those in the transportation graphs.

Moreover, these patterns are closely related to their spatiotemporal context and associated with multiple probabilistic attributes including the contribution and impact factors, and thus the existing graph visualization methods  $[43, 48, 59]$  cannot be directly applied. To help users locate interesting patterns and inspect the detailed propagation processes, we adopt a visual representation with two levels of detail for the patterns. The first level of detail (Fig. 1C1) comprises a list of compact *pattern glyphs* that outline the spatiotemporal information of each pattern, with which users can obtain a brief overview about the spatial contexts and temporal distributions of the patterns (i.e., when and where the pattern occurred)  $(G3)$ . Thereafter, users can add a pattern to the inspection list (Fig. 1C4), where the detailed propagation processes of each added pattern will be depicted with a *pattern graph* on the map served as the second level of detail  $(G4)$ . Additionally, in the projection view, we lay out the patterns according to their similarities computed based on the word2vec model [39,40] to assist users in identifying pattern clusters and outliers efficiently  $(G5)$ .",

The experts were interested in these patterns because there were many coal-fired power plants around Shijiazhuang.",

Based on the requirements and design goals, we developed AirVis, a visual analytics system that assists users in hierarchically exploring and interpreting massive propagation patterns extracted with a novel FSM-based pattern mining framework. The effectiveness of our system is demonstrated via two case studies conducted on the real-world dataset and the positive feedback received from the experts. Our approach is also generalizable to other similar problems that involve the topology-driven analysis of massive small graphs.

Moreover, the current graphical approaches for air pollution analysis lack interactive and sharable multi-perspective visualizations. The public urgently needs rapid and reliable knowledge on air pollution to make daily decisions. Similarly, most of the government staff are not professionals and need intuitive understanding of the conditions before they can execute any actions against the increasingly serious air pollutants. Thus, a visual methodology is needed for efficient and reliable exploration, particularly in the case of air pollution data, to improve the depth, readability, and accuracy of data analysis. We were motivated by the idea of visual thinking and the geovisualization concept [\\[12\\]](#page-18-15), which may be well suited for the exploration of air pollution data. Building on the extensive body of previous work, our paper presents a visualization exploration method that realizes the process of observation\u2013hypothesis\u2013verification. This method was tested and validated in a year-long case study of the air quality index (AQI of  $PM_{2.5}$ ) in Beijing, China. The useful findings of air pollution in Beijing show that our new method extends the existing work and fills a gap in the research, focusing on visual exploration to support various applications, such as knowledge-based decision making and aided research of air pollution.",

However, wind speed has a negative correlation with  $PM_{2.5}$ ,  $PM_{10}$ , and  $NO_2$ , which have high negative *r* values. Precipitation exhibits an extremely weak negative correlation with the pollutants. The strong positive correlation between  $PM_{2.5}$  and  $PM_{10}$ shown in Figure 8 verifies the findings in [7]. Because  $PM_{2.5}$  and  $PM_{10}$  are defined as particles with diameters of 2.5 \u00b5m or less and 10 \u00b5m or less, respectively, the relationship reveals that the particle density distributed stably according to their sizes. The positive correlation between pollutants indicates that  $PM_{2.5}$ ,  $PM_{10}$ , and  $NO_2$  may be emitted by the same sources, or one may be emitted by the transformation of another through some type of chemical mechanism [38]. To determine the specific reasons, a combined physical and chemical analysis of pollutants is desirable [19].",

Based on a series of multi-perspective visualizations of  $PM_{2.5}$  data for Beijing, we conclude that the following propositions are suitable topics for further empirical study:",
