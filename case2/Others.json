The traffic volume and average driving speed data are new datasets within all known air pollution related research. The traffic volume is collected hourly by vehicle detector devices at survey points in the road. They have both the inflow and outflow directions along the survey roads. The average driving speed data is also collected hourly and by the speed checkpoints. In fig. 2, we plot the locations of all traffic volume and vehicle speed survey points in the Seoul city's map. As we can observe, the traffic volume survey points and speed checkpoints are dense and cover quite well the area of Seoul city compared with the air pollution monitoring stations (in markers). Table I also represents some statistic analysis of these 2 datasets. In Table I, turns/hr is the number of vehicles running across a survey point in an hour.",

We also confirm in this paper that by transforming air pollution data into sequences of images, a ConvLSTM model is the best suitable for the air pollution interpolation and prediction problem, outperforms other baselines based on recurrent neural network (RNN) or convolutional neural network (CNN). Furthermore, ConvLSTM model helps us to learn the spatial and temporal features of input data at the same time and automatically, surpassing recent research that much relied on hand-crafted spatiotemporal features.

To measure the error, we alternately set the air pollution value of each existed input pixel to zero, keep other data of that pixel unchanged, running the trained model on this modified input data and calculate RMSE between the inferred value with the actual pixel value of the same position. The final error is the mean of all errors after doing this procedure with all existing air pollution values. We call this error spRMSE, which means the RMSE caused by spatiotemporal factors. The experiments results are shown in Table III. We can notice that ConvLSTM + Speed model has a better spRMSE than ConvLSTM in spite it has worse overall RMSE; which indicates the driving average speed affects air pollution in spatiotemporal form.

        "paragraph_info": "In this research, we have introduced 3 main contributions. First, we described and resolved the citywide scale Air Pollution Interpolation and Prediction problem by considering a whole city to be one image. Second, we pointed out and collected several spatiotemporal datasets, which have effects on air pollution throughout the city. Lastly, we proposed a spatiotemporal Deep Learning based model for citywide air pollution interpolation and prediction. We proved that the proposed model does not only work better than CNN and LSTM themselves in spatial and temporal features analysis but also outperforms state-of-the-art relevant models. The leverage of using other spatiotemporal factors gives us a powerful model in interpolating and forecasting air pollution over the city.",

However, based on the statistical results of three-year data in Beijing which depicted in Figure 2(a), it still has above 20% ratio that air quality will be worse in the next few hours after rain. Though rain has a higher ratio of air quality will be better, it is still difficult to model the interaction as the effect is not absolute. The reason behind it is that air quality is affected by multiple factors simultaneously shown in Figure 1, which the interactions are complex. As a result, it is hard to determine the weight of each factor due to the dynamic environment. Likewise, it is very difficult to capture the spatio-temporal characterizations of air pollution dispersion as air quality changes over location and fluctuate along time without an obvious periodic pattern.",

In general, DeepAir can achieve an average accuracy of (81.1%, 63%, 46%) in (1-6h, 7-48h, sudden changes) for all cities. Comparing with FFA, our approach has a better performance in all nine cities, with 2.4%,  $12.2\\%,\\ 63.2\\%$  relative accuracy improvements on short-term, long-term and sudden changes prediction. The reason behind it is that FFA trains four separate prediction models for modeling influential features respectively, which may fail to capture the interactions among all factors. Also, FFA is a shallow method which cannot capture the underlying complex pattern of each factor. Moreover, the features in FFA is not strong enough as it ignores the dynamic change of weather forecasts.",

The formation rate at 1.7 nm during NPF with growth days (NPF with growth,  $87 \\text{ cm}^{-3} \\text{ s}^{-1}$ ) is similar to that observed previously at the same site by Kontkanen et al. (2016) in summer. The high formation rate, which is comparable to heavily polluted urban environments, such as Beijing and Shanghai in China (59\u2013225 cm<sup> $-3$ </sup> s<sup> $-1$ </sup>; Deng et al., 2020; Yao et al., 2018), will be further discussed in Sect. 3.4. The average formation rate ( $J_{1.7}$ ) on NPF days without growth ( $24 \\text{ cm}^{-3} \\text{ s}^{-1}$ ) is much lower. During noontime, the formation rate of particles for NPF events with no growth was less than half of NPF with growth (Fig. S2). This suggests that, for particles to grow in a polluted environment such as the Po Valley, there needs to be abundant clustering to overcome losses to the existing condensation sink so that at least some of the particles survive to grow into larger sizes.",

Detailed descriptions of the new method can be found in our previous work (Yu et al., 2021, 2023). In brief, the analyzer system integrates two commercial instruments: an online aerosol carbon (C) analyzer and a chemiluminescence  $NO_x$  analyzer. Carbonaceous and nitrogenous aerosols collected on quartz filters were thermally evolved under programmed temperatures and then catalytically oxidized to  $CO_2$  and nitrogen oxides ( $NO_{\\nu}$ ), respectively. The C signal was monitored using the non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) method, while the N signal was recorded through chemiluminescence detection after converting  $NO_{\\nu}$  to NO. The C signal assists in differentiating IN and ON components since ON aerosols produce both C and N signals, while the IN fraction only gives an N signal. The programmed thermal evolution facilitates the separation of aerosol IN and ON, as they exhibit distinct thermal characteristics. The quantification of IN and ON is achieved through multivariate curve resolution data treatment of C and N thermal fractions (Yu et al., 2021).",

The experts suggested that the low uncertainty of such topology might result from the constant and strong winds along these paths. Moreover, the temporal distributions and the propagation direction arrows also showed that the propagation patterns from southwest to northeast (e.g., the first two patterns in Fig. [1C](#page-0-0)) mainly occurred in autumn and early winter, whereas those in the reversed direction (e.g., the last three patterns in Fig. [1C](#page-0-0)) often occurred in late winter and spring. This phenomenon is consistent with the meteorological conditions. While browsing the spatial contexts inside the glyphs, the experts found two patterns (i.e., the first two patterns in Fig. [1C](#page-0-0)) that started near Shijiazhuang in winter and autumn and propagated the air pollutants towards Langfang along two different but almost parallel paths.

The large sizes of the inner orange circles suggested that these two districts were seriously polluted. Moreover, the pie charts in Fig. [1C](#page-0-0)5 and [1C](#page-0-0)6 indicated that the pollution propagated along two different paths was largely contributed by the pollution in these two districts, which were constantly exposed to the pollution from Shijiazhuang. EA and EB hypothesized that the coal-fired power plants could be a severe air pollution source that had a considerable impact on remote regions. This hypothesis needs to be confirmed with advanced chemical reaction analysis. Moreover, EC also indicated that the pollution in Shijiazhuang might reach northeastern districts, including Beijing and Langfang, via these two paths. Therefore, informed pollution control policies can be made with these patterns, such as suspending a few power plants in Shijiazhuang based on the forecasted wind conditions, which has been proven to be particularly effective [\\[54\\]](#page-10-27).",

This can be visualized by scatterplots showing the relationship between any two factors. The second is that there is a regular time pattern for air pollutants. Heat maps would be an ideal visualization method, including a circle heat map, calendar view, and heat matrix, as generated using D3. The third hypothesis is that air contaminants have a geographical distribution. This can be represented appropriately by geovisualization, a method suitable for illustrating continuous spatial distributions. There are different ways to achieve Geovisualization with D3 or OpenLayers.",
