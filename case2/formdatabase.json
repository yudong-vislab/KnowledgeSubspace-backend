Predicting air quality for any regions and at any time is a critical requirement of urban citizens. However, air pollution prediction for the whole city is a challenging problem. The reason is, there are many spatiotemporal factors affecting air pollution throughout the city. Collecting as many of them could help us to forecast air pollution better. In this research, we present many spatiotemporal datasets collected over Seoul city in Korea, which is currently much suffered by air pollution problem as well. These datasets include air pollution data, meteorological data, traffic volume, average driving speed, and air pollution indexes of external areas which are known to impact Seoul's air pollution. To the best of our knowledge, traffic volume and average driving speed data are two new datasets in air pollution research. In addition, recent research in air pollution has tried to build models to interpolate and predict air pollution in the city. Nevertheless, they mostly focused on predicting air quality in discrete locations or used hand-crafted spatial and temporal features. In this paper, we propose the usage of Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) model [\\[16\\]](#page-7-0), a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks and Long Short-Term Memory, which automatically manipulates both the spatial and temporal features of the data.

We also confirm in this paper that by transforming air pollution data into sequences of images, a ConvLSTM model is the best suitable for the air pollution interpolation and prediction problem, outperforms other baselines based on recurrent neural network (RNN) or convolutional neural network (CNN). Furthermore, ConvLSTM model helps us to learn the spatial and temporal features of input data at the same time and automatically, surpassing recent research that much relied on hand-crafted spatiotemporal features. We will present in some next sections how we construct the input data to fit with ConvLSTM model and how to use it efficiently in air pollution relating problems.",

Since the prediction target has the same dimension as the input, to generate the final prediction, all the states in the forecasting network are concatenated and fed into a 1x1 convolution layer.",

Here, sudden changes mean that air quality index (AQI) drops very sharply in a very short time span [7]. As illustrated in Figure 2(b), AOI of air quality monitoring station  $S_2$  at the 30<sup>th</sup> timestamp drops over 200 in the coming two hours due to a strong wind blowing from the southeast.

As air pollutants are dispersed in geographical space, the former component regards the readings recorded by air quality monitoring stations as second-hand pollutant sources. Considering air pollutants' spatial correlations, spatial transformation component uses the spatial partition, spatial aggregation, and spatial interpolation to convert the spatial sparse air quality data into a consistent input, named AQIs. Then, AQIs and other datasets, i.e. meteorology, weather forecast, other pollutants, time, and station ID are fed into deep distributed fusion network, which adapts DNN to fuse heterogeneous urban data. We first use embedding method to transform the raw features of each domain data into a low-dimensional space for capturing temporal correlation and learning the intra-dynamics. Here, we use the embedding of AQIs to simulate the direct factors from local emission and regional transport and use the embedding of rest datasets as indirect factors respectively. Then, we propose a distributed fusion architecture to simultaneously model the interactions between these factors for learning the individual and holistic influences. As each indirect factor has own effort on direct factors affecting future air quality, we build four subnets (HW, WF, SP, and MP) to capture the individual influences from the historical weather, weather forecast, secondary productions, and meta properties from time and terrain, respectively. Besides individual influences, we build a subnet (HI) to learn the holistic influence by fusing all direct and indirect factors together. After that, the outputs of five subnets are aggregated by weighted merge to capture the high-level effects of these factors. Finally, the aggregation is mapped into [0, 1] by a Sigmoid function to generate final prediction results.",

Considering air pollutants' spatial correlations, spatial transformation component uses the spatial partition, spatial aggregation, and spatial interpolation to convert the spatial sparse air quality data into a consistent input, named AQIs. Then, AQIs and other datasets, i.e. meteorology, weather forecast, other pollutants, time, and station ID are fed into deep distributed fusion network, which adapts DNN to fuse heterogeneous urban data. We first use embedding method to transform the raw features of each domain data into a low-dimensional space for capturing temporal correlation and learning the intra-dynamics. Here, we use the embedding of AQIs to simulate the direct factors from local emission and regional transport and use the embedding of rest datasets as indirect factors respectively. Then, we propose a distributed fusion architecture to simultaneously model the interactions between these factors for learning the individual and holistic influences. As each indirect factor has own effort on direct factors affecting future air quality, we build four subnets (HW, WF, SP, and MP) to capture the individual influences from the historical weather, weather forecast, secondary productions, and meta properties from time and terrain, respectively. Besides individual influences, we build a subnet (HI) to learn the holistic influence by fusing all direct and indirect factors together. After that, the outputs of five subnets are aggregated by weighted merge to capture the high-level effects of these factors. Finally, the aggregation is mapped into [0, 1] by a Sigmoid function to generate final prediction results.",

Firstly, we partition the geographical space into 16 regions by four lines and two circles, e.g. 20 km and 100 km semidiameter.

Thus, we fill the missing values in these regions shown in Figure 5(d). More specifically, we first random generate some fake monitoring stations in these regions. Then, we use a classic spatial interpolation method, inverse distance weighting (IDW) [11], to interpolate the AQI of fake monitoring stations.

Firstly, we partition the geographical space into 16 regions by four lines and two circles, e.g. 20 km and 100 km semidiameter. As depicted in Figure 5(b), all regions share the target monitoring station (denoted by the black point) as common center and regions in the inner circle have a small area, while regions in the outer circle have a big area. Also, regions with different angles fit eight wind directions, which may be further captured by meteorological conditions. Furthermore, we aggregate the readings of air quality recorded by monitoring stations within the regions, illustrated in Figure 5(c). As a result, regions with at least one station will have one average AQI. However, from the partition results of Beijing, we find that different target stations have different missing patterns and about 33% regions do not have monitoring stations. Thus, we fill the missing values in these regions shown in Figure 5(d). More specifically, we first random generate some fake monitoring stations in these regions. Then, we use a classic spatial interpolation method, inverse distance weighting (IDW) [11], to interpolate the AQI of fake monitoring stations. Considering the readings of geospatially adjacent stations located in both inside and outside the outer circle, IDW assigns a weight to each available reading of geospatially adjacent stations by the distance to target sensor, and then aggregates these weights and readings by weighted average. After that, we aggregate the interpolated values of fake stations to calculate average AQI for the region. Finally, we get 17 AQI in one timestamp which 1 AQI come from target station and 16 AQI come from neighbor regions. We conduct the same process for each monitoring stations along time.",

Frequent NPF events have been observed in heavily polluted urban environments, contributing to the aerosol number concentration by a significant amount. The Po Valley region in northern Italy has been characterized as a hotspot for high aerosol loadings and frequent NPF events in southern Europe. However, the mechanisms of NPF and growth in this region are not completely understood. In this study, we conducted a continuous 2-month measurement campaign with stateof-the-art instruments to elucidate the NPF and growth mechanisms in northern Italy.

In contrast, oxygenated organic molecules from the atmospheric oxidation of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) appear to play a minor role in the initial cluster formation but contribute significantly to the consecutive growth process.

Generally, the high formation rates of sub-2 nm particles  $(87 \\text{ cm}^{-3} \\text{ s}^{-1})$  and nucleation-mode growth rates  $(5.1 \\text{ nm h}^{-1})$  as well as the relatively low condensational sink  $(8.9 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ s}^{-1})$  will result in a high survival probability for newly formed particles, making NPF crucial for the springtime aerosol number budget.

Even though we applied a similar definition of NPF events to that used in previous work, we can only compare our NPF with growth type with the reported NPF event frequency due to the lack of capacity to measure the sub-3 nm particles in previous literature. Our results were similar to those of Hamed et al.  $(2007)$ , who observed NPF events 36% of the time in March and April of 2002 at the same site. Manninen et al. (2010) observed NPF events during more than half of all days from March to October in 2008, whereas Kontkanen et al. (2016) observed NPF during 89 % of the days in July at the same site, which is higher than our observations. Hamed et al.  $(2007)$  also observed NPF with growth events on  $60\\%$  of the days during summer, which suggests that the summertime NPF frequency at SPC is typically higher than our observation in springtime 2022. This difference in the observed NPF frequency was likely due to the different season with favorable conditions for NPF, such as a potentially lower CS (due to less stagnant meteorological conditions) and higher alkaline- and organic-molecule concentrations in summer. In addition, the abundant solar radiation and low aerosol water content (limiting surface area and heterogenous reactions; Du et al., 2022) likely create favorable conditions for NPF to occur.",

    "paragraph_info": "al., 2021). In those experiments, amines, ammonia and aromatics were added to reflect an environment that was heavily influenced by anthropogenic emissions. Certain alkaline molecules, including amines (e.g., dimethylamine – DMA) and ammonia (NH3) have been shown to substantially enhance nucleation and reduce evaporation by stabilizing atmospheric SA in chamber studies (Almeida et al., 2013). Furthermore, oxygenated organic molecules (OOMs) can also contribute to NPF and subsequent particle growth, even without the inclusion of SA (Kirkby et al., 2016; Xiao et al., 2021). As shown in Fig. 3a, most of the measurements were above the SA–NH<sup>3</sup> system at 278 K from the CLOUD chamber, suggesting that the SA–NH<sup>3</sup> mechanism itself cannot solely explain the measured J1.<sup>7</sup> and that other species are most likely participating in NPF in the Po Valley. For instance, amines, such as DMA or trimethylamine (TMA), with higher basicity may contribute to NPF, consistent with non-negligible concentrations of amines in previous studies in the aerosol at SPC (Paglione et al., 2014; Decesari et al., 2014). For the whole sampling period, the median SA and J1.<sup>7</sup> values in the Po Valley follow the SA–DMA–NH<sup>3</sup> (4 ppt DMA and 1 ppb NH3) and SA–DMA–NH3–Org (adding additional oxidized aromatic organics; Xiao et al., 2021) lines from the CLOUD chamber at 293 K, even though the average noontime temperature was around 285 K during most of the NPF days (Fig. 3a).",

The growth rates observed here were similar to those observed by Kontkanen et al. (2016) at SPC in summer (7.2 nm  $h^{-1}$  for 7–20 nm). Moreover, our 1.5– 3 nm growth rate matches well with Manninen et al. (2010)  $(1.5 \\text{ nm h}^{-1})$  during spring in the Po Valley. A comparison to predicted growth rates from sulfuric acid condensation without organics, which was calculated based on kinetic collisions of the measured SA concentrations and the effect of van der Waals forces on the collision frequency (Stolzenburg et al., 2020), suggests that sulfuric acid condensation may be, on average, sufficient for the growth of the smallest clusters (Fig. 3c). This supports the argument that sulfuric acid and its stabilizing molecules (likely the bases, such as  $NH_3$  and amines) were controlling particle formation in the initial steps of NPF and growth in the Po Valley. However, for particles to grow beyond 3 nm in size, other vapors were needed, which was suggested by the significantly lower contribution of growth by SA (indicated by the green line) than the measured GR for  $3-7$  and  $7-15$  nm particles (Fig. 3c). Those vapors were likely a mixture of organics from anthropogenic and biogenic origins (with the latter emitted at higher rates during summer). We compared the GR during NPF with and without growth events using the method proposed in Kulmala et al.  $(2022)$ : the signal was averaged for all classified non-event days and an appearance time fit was then performed for each size channel independently, also revealing a growth pattern.

The values in parentheses represent the respective 25th and 75th percentiles of data (Fig. 3c). Growth rates increase with particle diameter, which is a phenomenon also observed in other campaigns around the world (Kontkanen et al., 2017; Kulmala et al., 2013), typically indicative of an increasing organic vapor contribution with size (e.g., Stolzenburg et al., 2018). The growth rates observed here were similar to those observed by Kontkanen et al. (2016) at SPC in summer (7.2 nm  $h^{-1}$  for 7–20 nm). Moreover, our 1.5– 3 nm growth rate matches well with Manninen et al. (2010)  $(1.5 \\text{ nm h}^{-1})$  during spring in the Po Valley. A comparison to predicted growth rates from sulfuric acid condensation without organics, which was calculated based on kinetic collisions of the measured SA concentrations and the effect of van der Waals forces on the collision frequency (Stolzenburg et al., 2020), suggests that sulfuric acid condensation may be, on average, sufficient for the growth of the smallest clusters (Fig. 3c). This supports the argument that sulfuric acid and its stabilizing molecules (likely the bases, such as  $NH_3$  and amines) were controlling particle formation in the initial steps of NPF and growth in the Po Valley. However, for particles to grow beyond 3 nm in size, other vapors were needed, which was suggested by the significantly lower contribution of growth by SA (indicated by the green line) than the measured GR for  $3-7$  and  $7-15$  nm particles (Fig. 3c).

    "paragraph_info": "Moreover, some SA-NH<sub>3</sub>-Org and I-containing ion clusters were also observed on NPF days, although to a much lower extent than clusters involving  $NH_3$  or DMA. It has been shown in previous CLOUD chamber studies that the oxidation products of anthropogenic volatile organic compounds (AVOCs, e.g., naphthalene, trimethylbenzene and toluene) can largely promote the formation rate of particles (Xiao et al., 2021). The I-containing ions (mainly  $\\text{IO}_3^-$ ) likely originated from the Adriatic Sea during the daytime. As no large iodine clusters were identified in the APi-ToF (e.g.,  $(HIO_3)_{0-1}(I_2O_5)_n \\cdot IO_3^-$ ; He et al., 2021), iodineinduced new particle formation in the Po Valley may not be as important as in the pristine marine environment (Sipila et al., 2016). During NPF without growth days, the formation mechanism was similar to the NPF days with respect to the ion cluster measurement (Fig. S5).",

At nighttime, the SA concentrations were close to zero due to the scavenging of  $SO_2$  and SA by the high RH (Fig. 1). During our sampling period, large amounts of organics were identified by the CI-APi-ToF. They were typically smaller than 400 Th with carbon numbers  $< 8$  and oxygen numbers  $< 6$  (Fig. S7). Due to the relatively high  $NO_x$  levels (13 ppb) that can terminate the dimerization reactions (Yan et al.,  $2020$ ), no OOM dimers were found, which is different from clean and biogenically dominated environments such as Hyytiälä (Lehtipalo et al., 2018). The compositions of OOMs were similar between NPF and non-NPF days, although with different abundance. Extremely high abundances of nitrophenols and their homologous compounds were found on non-NPF days ( $\\sim 8$  times higher than on NPF days), likely caused by both the enhanced primary, e.g., biomass burning (Mohr et al., 2013) and pesticide usage (Harrison et al., 2005), and secondary, e.g., photochemical and/or aqueous-phase secondary formation, sources (Zheng et al., 2021; Gilardoni et al., 2016).  $C_{2-4}H_{4.5}N_{0.1}O_{3.4}$  compounds were found to be 50 % higher (Fig. S7) on non-NPF days, likely caused by the enhanced heterogeneous reactions that form smaller organics, such as carboxylic acids, under higher-RH conditions. Previous studies have also reported aqueous-phase organic aerosol processing at high RH (Gilardoni et al., 2016) and high concentrations of carboxylic acids, such as formic, oxalic and malonic acids, in the springtime in the Po Valley (Saarikoski et al., 2012).

A slightly higher fraction of CHON compounds  $(73\\%)$  was found during non-NPF days than NPF days (67 %), consistent with higher  $NO_x$ and fine-particulate-matter levels (Fig. S8). This is likely associated with the stagnant meteorological conditions and the accumulation of pollutants during the non-NPF days. However, the overall high amounts of CHON compounds and the lack of organic dimers make it unlikely that OOMs drive the NPF process (both clustering and initial growth; see, e.g., Simon et al., 2020). Their similar abundance on non-NPF and NPF days was also in line with the similar estimated GR for both types of days.",

    "paragraph_info": "In this study, we conducted a continuous 2-month measurement campaign in the Italian Po Valley during springtime, where frequent NPF events were observed on 66 % of all days. Through direct ion cluster measurement, kinetic models and comparison with the CLOUD chamber experiment, we have determined that sulfuric acid–base nucleation is the dominant formation mechanism in the Po Valley region. Abundant sulfuric acid and alkaline molecules, including amines and ammonia derived from agriculture activities, provided ample precursors for NPF events. In contrast to megacity environments, the CS showed no significant difference between NPF event days and non-event days, indicating that it is more the abundance of precursors than the variations in the sink controlling the occurrence of NPF in the Po Valley. Furthermore, we observed that, apart from DMA, a typical basic precursor, NH<sup>3</sup> and other amines were also likely to be involved in NPF in the Po Valley. This was supported by the high abundance of SA–NH<sup>3</sup> and SA–NH3–amine clusters measured by the APi-ToF during NPF events. DMA, while more efficient than ammonia, was insufficient to stabilize all SA during our sampling period. This resulted in a more scattered correlation between sulfuric acid concentrations and measured formation rates compared with Chinese megacities. In that sense, we could show that the clustering during NPF is clearly distinct between polluted megacity environments and polluted semi-urbanized regions such as the Po Valley. Similar to Beijing, we found that OOMs did not play a decisive role in initial cluster formation, likely due to the absence of ultra-low-volatility organics (typical OOM dimers) in the ion and neutral cluster measurements. However, low-volatility organics were abundant enough to induce fast growth processes above 3 nm. The comparable GRs and formation rates, along with the lower efficient CS compared with megacity environments, indicate a high survival probability for the newly formed particles. Therefore, NPF is likely to play an important role in the fine-particle concentrations and pollution levels in the Po Valley region. Further reductions in key NPF species, including SO2, amines and NH3, can contribute to suppressing the NPF event frequency and lowering particle numbers. This, in turn, would improve air quality in the Po Valley region.",

    "paragraph_info": "In this study, we conducted a continuous 2-month measurement campaign in the Italian Po Valley during springtime, where frequent NPF events were observed on 66 % of all days. Through direct ion cluster measurement, kinetic models and comparison with the CLOUD chamber experiment, we have determined that sulfuric acid–base nucleation is the dominant formation mechanism in the Po Valley region. Abundant sulfuric acid and alkaline molecules, including amines and ammonia derived from agriculture activities, provided ample precursors for NPF events. In contrast to megacity environments, the CS showed no significant difference between NPF event days and non-event days, indicating that it is more the abundance of precursors than the variations in the sink controlling the occurrence of NPF in the Po Valley. Furthermore, we observed that, apart from DMA, a typical basic precursor, NH<sup>3</sup> and other amines were also likely to be involved in NPF in the Po Valley. This was supported by the high abundance of SA–NH<sup>3</sup> and SA–NH3–amine clusters measured by the APi-ToF during NPF events. DMA, while more efficient than ammonia, was insufficient to stabilize all SA during our sampling period. This resulted in a more scattered correlation between sulfuric acid concentrations and measured formation rates compared with Chinese megacities. In that sense, we could show that the clustering during NPF is clearly distinct between polluted megacity environments and polluted semi-urbanized regions such as the Po Valley. Similar to Beijing, we found that OOMs did not play a decisive role in initial cluster formation, likely due to the absence of ultra-low-volatility organics (typical OOM dimers) in the ion and neutral cluster measurements. However, low-volatility organics were abundant enough to induce fast growth processes above 3 nm.

Second, the quantification of both WSON and WION using the difference method introduces considerable uncertainty, especially when ON is a minor fraction of TN (Yu et al., 2021).

This approach produces WSON through taking the difference between WSTN and IN. Some studies have employed elemental analyzers for TN determination, calculating ON as the difference between TN and IN (Duan et al., 2009; Miyazaki et al., 2011; Pavuluri et al., 2015; Matsumoto et al., 2019). However, the elemental analyzers' detection limit of nitrogen is insufficient for accurate measurements of trace-level aerosol nitrogen (Duan et al., 2009), limiting its widespread use in aerosol nitrogen analysis. Despite significant uncertainty, a few studies suggested that WION, deduced by subtracting WSTN from TN, could be more abundant than WSON in coastal or urban areas (Pavuluri et al., 2015; Matsumoto et al., 2019), highlighting the necessity of quantifying total ON to determine the extent of ON aerosol presence. Second, the quantification of both WSON and WION using the difference method introduces considerable uncertainty, especially when ON is a minor fraction of TN (Yu et al., 2021). This approach has led to the reporting of physically implausible negative WSON concentrations in past studies (Mace et al., 2003; Nakamura et al., 2006; Violaki and Mihalopoulos, 2010; Yu et al., 2017).

The measurement principle and operational procedure of the TAG system have been described in detail in previous studies (Williams et al., 2006; He et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2021). In brief, the TAG system operated at a time resolution of 2 h. During the first hour, ambient air was drawn through a  $PM_{2.5}$  cyclone at a flow rate of  $10 \\text{ L min}^{-1}$ , passing through a carbon denuder to remove the gas phase, and particles were then collected onto a thermal desorption cell (CTD). In the second hour, the collected particles underwent thermal desorption and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. In each analysis, 5 µL of an internal standard mixture was added to the CTD that was loaded with particles collected in the preceding hour. During the thermal desorption step, the polar organic compounds in the  $PM_{2.5}$  were derivatized to their trimethylsilyl derivatives under a helium stream saturated with the derivatization agent Nmethyl-N-(trimethylsilyl) trifluoroacetamide (MSTFA). Subsequently, the organic compounds were reconcentrated onto a focusing trap cooled by a fan. Following this, the CTD was purged with pure helium to remove excess MSTFA, and the focusing trap was heated to  $330\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  to transfer the organic compounds into the valveless injection system, which utilizes a restrictive capillary tube to connect to the GC inlet. The GC-MS analysis was then initiated. A total of approximately 100 polar and non-polar organic compounds could be identified and quantified with authentic standards (Zhu et al., 2021). The individual TAG-measured source tracers used for PMF receptor modeling are listed in Table S1 in the Supplement.",

The measurement principle and operational procedure of the TAG system have been described in detail in previous studies (Williams et al., 2006; He et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2021). In brief, the TAG system operated at a time resolution of 2 h. During the first hour, ambient air was drawn through a  $PM_{2.5}$  cyclone at a flow rate of  $10 \\text{ L min}^{-1}$ , passing through a carbon denuder to remove the gas phase, and particles were then collected onto a thermal desorption cell (CTD). In the second hour, the collected particles underwent thermal desorption and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. In each analysis, 5 µL of an internal standard mixture was added to the CTD that was loaded with particles collected in the preceding hour. During the thermal desorption step, the polar organic compounds in the  $PM_{2.5}$  were derivatized to their trimethylsilyl derivatives under a helium stream saturated with the derivatization agent Nmethyl-N-(trimethylsilyl) trifluoroacetamide (MSTFA). Subsequently, the organic compounds were reconcentrated onto a focusing trap cooled by a fan. Following this, the CTD was purged with pure helium to remove excess MSTFA, and the focusing trap was heated to  $330\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  to transfer the organic compounds into the valveless injection system, which utilizes a restrictive capillary tube to connect to the GC inlet. The GC-MS analysis was then initiated. A total of approximately 100 polar and non-polar organic compounds could be identified and quantified with authentic standards (Zhu et al., 2021).

    "paragraph_info": "Quantification of a suite of speciated organic markers was conducted using a thermal desorption Aerosol Ggas chromatography-mass spectrometer (TAG, Aerodyne Research Inc.). The measurement principle and operational procedure of the TAG system have been described in detail in previous studies (Williams et al., 2006; He et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2021). In brief, the TAG system operated at a time resolution of 2 h. During the first hour, ambient air was drawn through a  $PM_{2.5}$  cyclone at a flow rate of  $10 \\text{ L min}^{-1}$ , passing through a carbon denuder to remove the gas phase, and particles were then collected onto a thermal desorption cell (CTD). In the second hour, the collected particles underwent thermal desorption and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. In each analysis, 5 µL of an internal standard mixture was added to the CTD that was loaded with particles collected in the preceding hour. During the thermal desorption step, the polar organic compounds in the  $PM_{2.5}$  were derivatized to their trimethylsilyl derivatives under a helium stream saturated with the derivatization agent Nmethyl-N-(trimethylsilyl) trifluoroacetamide (MSTFA). Subsequently, the organic compounds were reconcentrated onto a focusing trap cooled by a fan. Following this, the CTD was purged with pure helium to remove excess MSTFA, and the focusing trap was heated to  $330\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  to transfer the organic compounds into the valveless injection system, which utilizes a restrictive capillary tube to connect to the GC inlet. The GC-MS analysis was then initiated. A total of approximately 100 polar and non-polar organic compounds could be identified and quantified with authentic standards (Zhu et al., 2021). The individual TAG-measured source tracers used for PMF receptor modeling are listed in Table S1 in the Supplement.",

IN concentration was on average  $3.34 \\pm 2.16 \\,\\mu\\text{g} \\,\\text{N}\\,\\text{m}^{-3}$  and displayed a large variation from 0.34 to  $21.05 \\,\\mu\\mathrm{g} \\,\\mathrm{N} \\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$ . ON accounted for  $6\\%$ – $58\\%$  of the total N in aerosols, with an average of approximately 20%. This percentage was significantly lower than  $(p<0.001)$  the value (25 %) observed at the same location during the summer of 2021 (Yu et al., 2023). The difference was attributed to the higher enhancement of IN (2.2 $\\times$ ) compared to ON (1.8 $\\times$ ) from summer to winter. During the winter observation, ON exhibited significantly higher concentrations at nighttime  $(0.85 \\,\\mu\\text{g N m}^{-3})$ compared to daytime (0.75  $\\mu$ g N m<sup>-3</sup>) ( $p$ <0.005) (Fig. 1). This result contradicted the findings from summertime measurements, which showed higher ON concentrations during daytime (Yu et al., 2023). From summer to winter, the daytime and nighttime ON concentrations increased by a factor of 1.56 and 2.13, respectively, suggesting that nocturnal formation of ON aerosols might be more significant in winter. The concentration of aerosol IN was higher during nighttime in both summer and winter periods at the urban site.",

    "paragraph_info": "In this study, bihourly measurements of aerosol total ON, together with a comprehensive list of organic and inorganic source markers, were available. These data enabled a quantitative source apportionment of ON using PMF receptor modeling. The PMF results allowed investigation of the diel variations in ON sources. Details regarding the PMF configuration and diagnostics are provided in Text S1 in the Supplement. Benefiting from the comprehensive array of molecular source tracers, the PMF analysis resolved a total of 18 factors, including eight primary emission sources and 10 secondary formation sources. The factor profiles and contributions are displayed in Figs. S3 and S4 in the Supplement, respectively. Source identification was based on established molecular and elemental markers (Qiao et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2015). These factors and their corresponding markers are as follows. (1) Industrial emissions were represented by manganese (Mn), iron (Fe), and zinc (Zn). (2) Coal combustion was identified through selenium (Se) and lead (Pb). (3) Biomass burning was characterized by the presence of levoglucosan, mannosan, and galactosan. (4) Vehicle emissions were indicated by hopanes, nitrogen oxides  $(NO_x)$ , and elemental carbon (EC). (5) Residue oil combustion was marked by high loadings of nickel (Ni). (6) Cooking emissions were indicated by saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. (7) Oxygenated cooking OA formation was characterized by the high loadings of azelaic acid, 9-oxononanoic acid, and nonanoic acid, which are oxidation products of oleic acid or other unsaturated fatty acids with  $-C = C$  at the C9 position that are emitted directly from cooking activities (Huang et al., 2021a; Wang and Yu, 2021). This factor reflects secondary oxidation products originating from primary cooking emissions and showed pronounced enhancements during dinner hours, as illustrated in Fig. S4a. (8) Sea salt emissions were distinguished by sodium  $(Na^+)$  and chloride  $(Cl^-)$ . (9) Soil dust was indicated by silicon (Si) and calcium (Ca).

This finding was consistent with the summertime measurements at the same site that vehicle emissions and coal combustion dominated the primary emission sources of ON (Yu et al., 2023). The contribution of coal combustion to ON was higher during nighttime, whereas the contribution of vehicle emissions increased during traffic rush hours (Fig. 2c).

Biomass burning has been recognized as an important source of aerosol ON (Mace et al., 2003; Chen and Chen, 2010; Yu et al., 2017). In this study, we found that a negligible fraction of ON was apportioned to the primary biomass burning factor while a notable presence (7.2 %) of ON in the factor of nitrocatechol formation processes (Fig. 2).

Biomass burning has been recognized as an important source of aerosol ON (Mace et al., 2003; Chen and Chen, 2010; Yu et al., 2017). In this study, we found that a negligible fraction of ON was apportioned to the primary biomass burning factor while a notable presence (7.2 %) of ON in the factor of nitrocatechol formation processes (Fig. 2). Nitrocatechols are probably formed through the nitration of catechols emitted from biomass burning. This secondary formation pathway was supported by the good correlation between levoglucosan and nitrocatechols (Fig. S7). The contribution of primary cooking emissions to ON was generally low, averaging 2 % across the observation period. However, this contribution increased to 5 ± 4 % (ranging from 0.8 % to 17 %) during dinner time (Fig. 2).",

This fraction of SON may indicate the formation of organic nitrates, which share common precursor of  $NO_x$  with nitrate. Organic nitrates have long been recognized as notable components of secondary OAs in ambient air (Rollins et al., 2012; Perring et al., 2013). Organic nitrate formation encompasses two main pathways: hydroxyl radical (OH)-initiated oxidation of hydrocarbons in the presence of  $NO_x$  during the day and nitrate radical ( $NO_3$ )-initiated oxidation of alkenes during the night. Both pathways involve the formation of organic nitrates in the gas phase, followed by partitioning to the particulate phase (Perring et al., 2013). This study, through integrated analyses of SON and SOC, provides evidence suggesting that organic nitrates might also form through heterogeneous or aqueous reactions. As depicted in Fig. 4, the nitrate formation process produced  $0.17 \\,\\mu\\text{g N m}^{-3}$  of  $\\Delta\\text{SON}$  and  $0.43 \\,\\mu\\text{g C m}^{-3}$  of  $\\Delta\\text{SOC}$  from the night of 20 December to the following morning, yielding a  $\\Delta$ SOC /  $\\Delta$ SON atomic ratio of only 2.9.

In a previous study, it was suggested that organic nitrates can be produced through non-radical reactions of hydrated glyoxal and nitric acid in the aqueous phase (Lim et al., 2016). Xu et al. (2020) found that aerosol liquid water promotes the formation of water-soluble ON, probably in the form of organic nitrate species. Previous studies have identified an 80 % underestimation of monoterpene hydroxyl nitrate by the GEOS-Chem model, which considers both OH oxidation and  $NO_3$  oxidation mechanisms of monoterpene (Li et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2021), indicating an incomplete understanding of the formation mechanisms of organic nitrates.

This fraction of SON may indicate the formation of organic nitrates, which share common precursor of  $NO_x$  with nitrate. Organic nitrates have long been recognized as notable components of secondary OAs in ambient air (Rollins et al., 2012; Perring et al., 2013). Organic nitrate formation encompasses two main pathways: hydroxyl radical (OH)-initiated oxidation of hydrocarbons in the presence of  $NO_x$  during the day and nitrate radical ( $NO_3$ )-initiated oxidation of alkenes during the night. Both pathways involve the formation of organic nitrates in the gas phase, followed by partitioning to the particulate phase (Perring et al., 2013).

This study, through integrated analyses of SON and SOC, provides evidence suggesting that organic nitrates might also form through heterogeneous or aqueous reactions. As depicted in Fig. 4, the nitrate formation process produced  $0.17 \\,\\mu\\text{g N m}^{-3}$  of  $\\Delta\\text{SON}$  and  $0.43 \\,\\mu\\text{g C m}^{-3}$  of  $\\Delta\\text{SOC}$  from the night of 20 December to the following morning, yielding a  $\\Delta$ SOC /  $\\Delta$ SON atomic ratio of only 2.9. Gas-phase formation of organic nitrates followed by gas-to-particle partitioning would not result in such a low  $C/N$  ratio. Therefore, a large number of organic nitrates might be formed through heterogeneous or aqueous reactions between organic compounds and  $\\text{HNO}_3 / \\text{NO}_3$ , enhancing the ON content while not affecting the OC content which is already present in the particle phase. In a previous study, it was suggested that organic nitrates can be produced through non-radical reactions of hydrated glyoxal and nitric acid in the aqueous phase (Lim et al., 2016). Xu et al. (2020) found that aerosol liquid water promotes the formation of water-soluble ON, probably in the form of organic nitrate species. Previous studies have identified an 80 % underestimation of monoterpene hydroxyl nitrate by the GEOS-Chem model, which considers both OH oxidation and  $NO_3$  oxidation mechanisms of monoterpene (Li et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2021), indicating an incomplete understanding of the formation mechanisms of organic nitrates. Our observational results, combined with previous investigations, suggest the need for further exploration of the formation mechanisms of particulate organic nitrates, such as heterogeneous/aqueous phase reaction processes.",

To find the causes of air pollution, the propagation processes of air pollutants must be studied at a large spatial scale. However, the complex and dynamic wind fields lead to highly uncertain pollutant transportation. The state-of-the-art data mining approaches cannot fully support the extensive analysis of such uncertain spatiotemporal propagation processes across multiple districts without the integration of domain knowledge. The limitation of these automated approaches motivates us to design and develop AirVis, a novel visual analytics system that assists domain experts in efficiently capturing and interpreting the uncertain propagation patterns of air pollution based on graph visualizations. Designing such a system poses three challenges: a) the extraction of propagation patterns; b) the scalability of pattern presentations; and c) the analysis of propagation processes. To address these challenges, we develop a novel pattern mining framework to model pollutant transportation and extract frequent propagation patterns efficiently from large-scale atmospheric data. Furthermore, we organize the extracted patterns hierarchically based on the minimum description length (MDL) principle and empower expert users to explore and analyze these patterns effectively on the basis of pattern topologies.

In essence, air pollution propagation can be regarded as a type of movement data. Spatiotemporal visualization for movement data can generally be classified into three categories [\\[1\\]](#page-9-19), namely, direct depiction, summarization, and pattern extraction. Specifically, movement data can be directly depicted using visual elements, such as points [\\[17\\]](#page-9-20) for OD pairs, polylines [\\[2\\]](#page-9-21), tubes [\\[34\\]](#page-9-22), stacked bands [\\[56\\]](#page-10-11), and space-time cubes [\\[3\\]](#page-9-23) for trajectories.

Therefore, informed pollution control policies can be made with these patterns, such as suspending a few power plants in Shijiazhuang based on the forecasted wind conditions, which has been proven to be particularly effective [\\[54\\]](#page-10-27).",

    "paragraph_info": "**Abstract:** In recent years, frequent occurrences of significant air pollution events in China have routinely caused panic and are a major topic of discussion by the public and air pollution experts in government and academia. Therefore, this study proposed an efficient visualization method to represent directly, quickly, and clearly the spatio-temporal information contained in air pollution data. Data quality check and cleansing during a preliminary visual analysis is presented in tabular form, heat matrix, or line chart, upon which hypotheses can be deduced. Further visualizations were designed to verify the hypotheses and obtain useful findings. This method was tested and validated in a year-long case study of the air quality index (AQI of PM2.5) in Beijing, China. We found that PM2.5, PM10, and NO<sup>2</sup> may be emitted by the same sources, and strong winds may accelerate the spread of pollutants. The average concentration of PM2.5 in Beijing was greater than the AQI value of 50 over the six-year study period. Furthermore, arable lands exhibited considerably higher concentrations of air pollutants than vegetation-covered areas. The findings of this study showed that our visualization method is intuitive and reliable through data quality checking and information sharing with multi-perspective air pollution graphs. This method allows the data to be easily understood by the public and inspire or aid further studies in other fields.",

Data quality check and cleansing during a preliminary visual analysis is presented in tabular form, heat matrix, or line chart, upon which hypotheses can be deduced. Further visualizations were designed to verify the hypotheses and obtain useful findings. This method was tested and validated in a year-long case study of the air quality index (AQI of PM2.5) in Beijing, China. We found that PM2.5, PM10, and NO<sup>2</sup> may be emitted by the same sources, and strong winds may accelerate the spread of pollutants. The average concentration of PM2.5 in Beijing was greater than the AQI value of 50 over the six-year study period. Furthermore, arable lands exhibited considerably higher concentrations of air pollutants than vegetation-covered areas. The findings of this study showed that our visualization method is intuitive and reliable through data quality checking and information sharing with multi-perspective air pollution graphs.

Our previous work, a Real-time Sensor Data Provision system (ReSDaP) [29-31], achieved the on-demand data provision for the Database. Data are then checked and analyzed by the Preliminary analysis block through various basic visual methods, such as bar charts, heat tables, and line charts. Based on these data, hypotheses can be built and verified through further visual analytics. Finally, the findings of previous steps can be used for applications.",
