The prior approaches extract one causal graph given long- time observations, which cannot be directly applied to capturing, interpreting, and validating dynamic urban causality. This paper presents Compass, a novel visual analytics approach for in- depth analyses of the dynamic causality in urban time series. To develop Compass, we identify and address three challenges: detecting urban causality, interpreting dynamic causal relations, and unveiling suspicious causal relations. First, multiple causal graphs over time among urban time series are obtained with a causal detection framework extended from the Granger causality test. Then, a dynamic causal graph visualization is designed to reveal the time- varying causal relations across these causal graphs and facilitate the exploration of the graphs along the time. Finally, a tailored multi- dimensional visualization is developed to support the identification of spurious causal relations, thereby improving the reliability of causal analyses.

However, the patterns and insights derived in these studies do not imply true causality, and thus the reliability of the results is often limited in applications. Recent studies [38, 89] have investigated applying the Granger causality test to capture the causal relations among urban time series. Based on a set of urban time series, these studies attempt to extract a causal graph, where each cause- effect relation between a pair of sensors is represented with a directed edge. However, one causal graph is insufficient to characterize the dynamic causal relations among multiple urban time series due to the rapidly- changing urban environments. For example, a causal relation between two sensors detected based on their time series can disappear or even be flipped from time to time (Fig. 2a) because of certain external factors, such as the wind fields in the air pollution scenarios. Such a dynamic nature demands fine- grained causality analyses that enable analysts to gain insights into the temporal variations of causal relations in urban contexts. In addition to the limitation of granularity in the prior studies, interpreting and validating these causal relations detected by automated models also require an interactive system to integrate analysts in the urban causality analysis loop [76]."

    "paragraph_info": "This study is the result of cooperation with multiple domains. On the one hand, rapid urbanization has resulted in many notorious urban problems, such as noise [9], traffic congestion [53], and water/air pollution [46]. On the other hand, various applications have proven the utility of causal analysis in providing valuable implications. In the past six months, we collaborated closely with three experts (EA, EB and EC). EA and EB are urban computing experts who have decades of experience studying data- driven solutions for urban problems. EC is a researcher with expertise in causal analyses. We together attempt to apply causal analysis to solve the urban problems. As a statistical analysis method, causal analysis is not limited to computer scientists but can be accepted by urban practitioners with statistical knowledge."

For every causal relation, the two involved time series are sliced according to the time window and displayed together in the same line chart on the glyph's right side. The lines are also colored according to the sensor. Users can easily compare the time series of all sensors involved in the graph because these glyphs are aligned vertically in a graph band."

A causal detection framework and temporal visualizations are combined to unveil these dynamic causalities.

The static causal graphs detected by the previous methods will ignore these time- varying cause- effect relationships and thus cannot support accurate and informed decisions.

Although ego graph- like causal graphs support an effective analysis for the target area, causal analyses can be enhanced with more complex causal graphs, such as by involving the relations between neighbor sensors. However, analyzing the complex graphs in a spatiotemporal context is challenging. For example, visual clutter is hard to avoid because the geo- fixed nodes make the causal graph layout methods inapplicable [65,76]. It also becomes difficult to clearly reveal the temporal variations of the detected causalities as the number of edges increases. Utilizing the third dimension can be a potential solution [5, 14, 62, 80] and deserves further study. Secondly, due to the lack of multi- source datasets in the same temporal and spatial scope, the effectiveness of our method in cross- domain causal analysis has not been proven. In fact, causality may exist between different urban datasets. For example, as the traffic volume increases, the air quality will deteriorate because cars emit exhaust gas and pollute the air [83]. In the future, we will collect richer datasets and conduct studies, thereby evaluating and improving our approaches. Finally, we found that when the number of links to be tested in all time windows is more than 150, the calculation time exceeds ten seconds. In the future, we will optimize the detection model, implement it with a more high- performance programming language, and deploy it to a distributed computing server."

This study compared the optimization effects of these two methods and developed a new scheme that combines DA and BC simultaneously. Four parallel experiments were conducted during winter 2019: a control experiment directly forecasted by WRF- Chem (experiment name: WRF- Chem); an experiment that assimilated in situ observations based on the GSI (Gridpoint Statistical Interpolation) system (WRF- Chem_DA); an experiment with deep- learning- based BC (WRF- Chem_BC); and an experiment considering the combination of DA on the initial conditions and BC (WRF- Chem_DA_BC). Statistically, the accuracy of  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  predictions could be optimized by both DA and BC for the first 24- h period, and WRF- Chem_BC performed better than WRF- Chem_DA in the initial field, especially in the period of 10–24 h, while the best performance was achieved by combining BC and DA. Throughout the initial 24- h period, compared with the control experiment, the results of WRF- Chem_DA_BC (WRF- Chem_DA, WRF- Chem_BC) showed an improvement in terms of root- mean- square error, with reduction proportions varying from 38.90% to 48.86% (18.88% to 32.44%, 30.10% to 46.08%). Besides having the best optimization effect over the whole domain, the combined method also performed well in different regions: during the forecasting period of 0–24 h, the RMSEs decreased from 32% to 62%, 39% to 57%, 28% to 40%, and 30% to 49% in the Beijing- Tianjin- Hebei, Yangtze River Delta, Central China, and Sichuan Basin urban agglomerations, respectively."

    "paragraph_info": "BC is a statistical method that improves model predictions by establishing a relationship between historical observations and the corresponding model forecasts, from which the forecast bias can be extracted and the systematic errors corrected. With the advancements made in this line of research, BC methods have been developed from the earlier complete forecast method (Klein et al., 1959) to the model output statistical method (Glahn and Lowry, 1972), and then gradually evolved into different BC schemes. Frequency matching, Bayesian averaging, least- squares regression, multiple linear regression, and other statistical methods have been used to establish BC models, which significantly reduce systematic errors by learning the empirical relationships between historical forecasts and observations to realize BC (Raftery et al., 2005; Zhu and Luo, 2015; Xie et al., 2012; Chen et al., 2012; You, 2014). Recently, artificial- intelligence machine- learning techniques have emerged. Subsequently, BC based on machine- learning methods has been shown to better express the auxiliary links between various facets of the atmosphere, including, for instance, the different elements involved in atmospheric chemistry and key basic meteorological variables such as temperature and winds (Marzban, 2003; Zhang et al., 2022). Machine- learning models have been used in the BC of model outputs to improve  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  forecasts. For example, Ran et al. (2023) performed BC based on a multiple linear regression modeling approach to reduce the global  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  prediction bias; and Liu and Xing (2022a), Liu and Xing (2022b) designed a fully connected deep neural network to correct the  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  concentration bias in the outputs of chemical models, achieving better results than without the correction method applied. Ma et al. (2020) applied a time series model to correct  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  forecasts, which achieved good results. Different machine- learning methods were utilized by Li et al. (2021) as bias adjustment for postprocessing forecasts of  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  and  $\\mathrm{O}_3$ , showing the optimal approach to be the Random Forest model. Lu et al. (2020) utilized machine- learning methods to improve the accuracy of  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  forecasts through WRF- Chem in the Chengdu- Chongqing region. Overall, machine- learning methods have shown strong advantages in mining nonlinear relationships, enabling them to perform well in the BC of numerical predictions. However, they usually require massive, multi- source data inputs, which can limit their applicability in specific scenarios."

In this study, we only considered the effect of DA through adjustment of the initial aerosol field, which may have had limitations on the optimization effects. The adjustment of emissions has been proved to be critical in terms of the improvement of aerosol predictions in previous studies (Henze et al., 2009; Ku and Park, 2011). As such, greater optimization might be achievable by the additional assimilation of air quality data through applying an inverse method to retrieve an optimized emission inventory based on the model configuration as in the WRF- Chem_DA_BC experiment, which will be analyzed in future work."

It is similar to the methodology applied in a previous study (31), in which we analyze AOD and considered all aerosols instead of carbonaceous aerosols only. Briefly, we linearly regressed modeled MAC against modeled SSA and modeled  $\\tau$  against modeled precipitation and the angstrom exponent (AE; an indicator of ambient particle size) using the model data from the AeroCom (Aerosol Comparisons between Observations and Models; see table S1) project. Then, we applied satellite observations of SSA to estimate the constrained MAC and similarly constrain  $\\tau$  from observations of precipitation and AE. Last, we used Eq. 1 to constrain  $E$  The constrained values of  $E,\\tau ,$  and MAC allow us to attribute AAOD errors to contributions from these three factors for individual models. Uncertainty analysis is conducted for all these constraining processes as shown in Fig. 1. Notably, the constrained results are only effective on a regional and seasonal scale, and caution must be exercised when directly applying these results to smaller scales. This work presents advancements upon the foundation of (31) as it constrains MAC instead of MEC (mass extinction coefficient). In addition, we implement in situ data in the interpretation of satellite observations that allows a disaggregation of BC and OC emissions. Furthermore, in our seasonal, regional analysis, we find that SOA formation is important for fire aerosols over the Amazon but not over Africa."

The relationship is also confirmed by Mie calculations with varying configurations (e.g., mixing state, refractive index, and particle size; fig. S2).

The remarkable regional difference may be associated with the variation in precursor gas emissions from biogenic sources, with a notably higher level of such emissions found over the Amazon than over Africa (fig. S14). In comparison, model estimates of SOA production are very uncertain and usually fail to show regional differences between the Amazon and Africa. Our estimation, to our knowledge, is the first one in which SOA formation is constrained by aerosol absorption, which provides an innovative perspective on SOA estimation. The results also highlight the importance of SOA during fire seasons. This particular aspect has often been overlooked, and our findings emphasize the need for further research."

The remaining models are then used to predict the emission, lifetime, and MAC of the truth run following the same procedure as described above (the regression between SSA and ambient rBC is replaced with the modeled relationship; see fig. S6). As shown in fig. S21, the predicted values agree well with truth model data, demonstrating the robustness of the methodology. In particular, the average of the absolute relative errors for predicted BC emissions are 17 and  $14\\%$  for the Amazon and Southern Africa, respectively, which are much smaller than the uncertainty in our main analysis using real observations. This suggests that the overall uncertainty of our constraining analysis is primarily affected by observational errors, as corroborated by our uncertainty analysis shown in fig. S15."

For the second challenge, GeoChron supports a novel two- level visualization mechanism to present the spatiotemporal information of large- scale ST series. At the first level, we revise the Storyline with new interactions and visual encodings, and link it with a geographic map, to present evolution patterns from a high level of perspective. At the second level, we employ an EvoLens, a lens placed on the Storyline, to display more details regarding the temporal trends of evolution patterns in a narrative- preserving manner.

After detecting sessions for each slice, we can apply Storyline. Our framework divides the time span evenly into  $T$  slices, denoted as  ${s_1,\\ldots ,s_T}$ , with equal size (e.g., Fig. 3A). Each time slice  $s = (t_s,t_e)$  has a time period structure. The slice size depends on the domain- specific scenario. For example, air pollution data are often reviewed on a daily basis [55], and the size of one day is appropriate. A smaller size is not enough to capture prominent features, and a larger size may miss the dynamics. Afterward, Steps 2- 4 below are executed for each time slice."

Since every pattern is represented as a session in the Storyline, the visualization should enable interactive analysis based on sessions. G2 Support effective tracking. The correlation relationship between ST series is dynamic and thereby evolution patterns present complex spatial and temporal relationships between each other. Therefore, the design should implement flexible interactions for tracking the evolution patterns as well as ST series in the Storyline. G3 Visualize temporal trends. Time series trends are the basic features in ST series [74]. Trends can facilitate the locating of interesting periods, e.g., when the readings of multiple ST series suddenly rise or fall. Besides, trends help users interpret dynamic correlation relations, e.g., why two ST series are correlated. Hence, the design should visually display the trends of time series over time. G4 Link spatial and temporal information. The spatial information of ST series is important for understanding evolution patterns. A geographic map is difficult to integrate into the compact and already information- dense Storyline. Therefore, linking the spatial and temporal information is more suitable than integrating them. G5 Provide multi- level analysis workflow. Large- scale ST series can exhibit rich information, e.g., the time series trends over a long time, spatial distribution on a vast space, and many- to- many spatiotemporal relations. Multi- level analysis is a well- known effective manner for accommodating a large amount of information. Thus, the design should support a multi- level analysis workflow."

Moreover, our study focuses on evolution patterns (i.e., sessions) rather than individual ST series (i.e., entities). Thus, we design an interactive session- based coloring (G1)."

Despite many advanced methodologies, the seamless integration of temporal and spatial information remains a challenge. The space- time cube (STC) stands out as a promising approach for the synergistic presentation of spatial and temporal information, with successful applications across various spatiotemporal datasets.

In this study, we introduce a novel technical framework termed VolumeSTCube, designed for continuous spatiotemporal phenomena. It first leverages the concept of the STC to transform discretely distributed spatial time series data into continuously volumetric data. Subsequently, volume rendering and surface rendering techniques are employed to visualize the transformed volumetric data. Volume rendering is utilized to mitigate visual occlusion, while surface rendering provides pattern details by enhanced lighting information. Lastly, we design interactions to facilitate the exploration and analysis from temporal, spatial, and spatiotemporal perspectives. VolumeSTCube is evaluated through a computational experiment, a real- world case study with one expert, and a controlled user study with twelve non- experts, compared against a baseline from prior work, showing its superiority and effectiveness in large- scale spatial time series analysis."

Linked views require users to pay context- switching costs to browse the spatial and temporal visualizations separately. In contrast, an integrated view tightly organizes the spatial and temporal visualizations to reduce such costs. The spacetime cube (STC) [6] is a kind of integrated view in a three- dimensional space, in which the space naturally occupies two dimensions (i.e., x- y plane), and the time constitutes the third dimension (i.e., z- axis). The position of the visual graphics can be directly related to both space and time dimensions. It is easy for users to accept and learn, and thus, users can perceive time and space simultaneously [7]. Moreover, in the STC, the evolution of spatiotemporal phenomena can be effectively conveyed through temporal narratives, as geographic- related information is visualized along a continuous timeline [8]."

Yet, adopting the STC to visualize large- scale ST series is still in an exploratory stage. Prior studies [14]- [16] adopted the STC to visualize ST series (e.g., Figure 1), but only a few timestamps (e.g.,  $\\leq 30$  are applicable. It remains unexplored how to enable in- depth visual analysis of large- scale, highly dynamic, and multi- correlated ST series data based on the STC.

For example, Yang et al.'s method [25] relied on user interactions: the temporal visualization at a location will be displayed after the user clicks the location on the map. In contrast, Li et al.'s method [30] and Zhao et al.'s method [26] adopted explicit encodings: each temporal visualization had a unique location ID that can be exactly related to the geographic context."

The time- varying values of the ST series can be mapped to the column's vertical position. Second, as shown in Figure 2B, the cube space is evenly divided into voxels, i.e., small regular cubes. We apply interpolation and temporal smoothing to estimate the value  $v$  for every voxel with a 3D position  $(x,y,z)$ . As a result, all voxels together constitute a space- time volume where the values of adjacent voxels tend to be continuous. Finally, the space- time volume is visualized with volume and surface rendering techniques (Figure 2C).

Assuming we are visualizing the ST series of air pollution concentration, below are some examples: If a voxel cluster extends significantly in the vertical direction and over the x- y plane, it indicates that the duration of poor air quality persists across a vast spatial area (Figure 3A①). If in a vertical cylindrical area in 3D cube space are voxel clusters with equal spacing, the air pollution exhibits periodicity at that location (Figure 3A②). If the voxel cluster exhibits shifts in 3D cube space, it indicates a process of air pollution propagation (Figure 3B and C)."

They can specify the time range based on the focus+context mechanism [58]- [60] or directly based on prior knowledge [61]. Brushing on the visualization along the timeline aligns with user interaction practices in conventional 2D views. A useful method is to integrate another 2D view in the 3D space for brushing [39]. In contrast, we map the brushing interaction to the volume slicing along the timeline (Figure 4A), allowing users to directly perform selection in the 3D space with less context switching. Similarly, given a vast space where data is hard to analyze, users usually perform spatial range selection first [3], [62]. Again, the selections with lassos and polygons on the map are difficult to issue in the 3D space. Hence, we design an interaction called volume spotlight for users to select a spatial range in the cube space (Figure 4B)."

First, the user can directly specify the center of the range on the geographic map. The map is an x- y plane perpendicular to the z- axis. Given the mouse pointer's position on the screen, we can compute the intersection of the map plane and the ray emitted from the mouse position on the screen. The center of the range is exactly the position of the intersection. Second, the radius can be specified by scrolling the mouse wheel. The range will be displayed as a black ellipse on the map for a visual hint."

Recall that VolumeSTCube allows us to easily locate the spotlight on the target region by directly pointing to the region on the map. The region was exactly the Xinjiang. PA clearly observed that starting around March, multiple significant air pollution events occurred (Figure 6C). During these events, the air quality in Xinjiang deteriorated notably, possibly due to the poor atmospheric dispersion conditions and the influence of dust storms [65]."

In the future, we plan to implement a rendering parameter adjustment control to alleviate this problem. For example, the mapping of values to transparency and color can be adjusted interactively. Finally, most subjects expressed that surface rendering offered clear boundaries for voxel clusters, aiding in obtaining specific values at spatiotemporal positions and assessing propagation processes.
