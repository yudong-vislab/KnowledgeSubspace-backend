        "paragraph_info": "*Abstract*\u2014Recently, air pollution is one of the most concerns for big cities. Predicting air quality for any regions and at any time is a critical requirement of urban citizens. However, air pollution prediction for the whole city is a challenging problem. The reason is, there are many spatiotemporal factors affecting air pollution throughout the city. Collecting as many of them could help us to forecast air pollution better. In this research, we present many spatiotemporal datasets collected over Seoul city in Korea, which is currently much suffered by air pollution problem as well. These datasets include air pollution data, meteorological data, traffic volume, average driving speed, and air pollution indexes of external areas which are known to impact Seoul's air pollution. To the best of our knowledge, traffic volume and average driving speed data are two new datasets in air pollution research. In addition, recent research in air pollution has tried to build models to interpolate and predict air pollution in the city. Nevertheless, they mostly focused on predicting air quality in discrete locations or used hand-crafted spatial and temporal features. In this paper, we propose the usage of Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) model [\\[16\\]](#page-7-0), a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks and Long Short-Term Memory, which automatically manipulates both the spatial and temporal features of the data. Specially, we introduce how to transform the air pollution data into sequences of images which leverages the using of ConvLSTM model to interpolate and predict air quality for the entire city at the same time. We prove that our approach is suitable for spatiotemporal air pollution problems and also outperforms other related research.",

From statistical results [3], Beijing recorded 46 days of heavy pollution during 2015, accounting for 12.6 percent of the year. For monitoring real-time air pollution, Chinese governments have built many air quality monitoring stations and published air quality data every hour in recent years [4].

The key point in distributed fusion architecture is that we specify one feature as main feature and other features as auxiliary features. The reason for this partition is main feature and prediction target come from the same domain, while auxiliary features and prediction target come from different domains.

The Po Valley region in northern Italy has been characterized as a hotspot for high aerosol loadings and frequent NPF events in southern Europe. However, the mechanisms of NPF and growth in this region are not completely understood. In this study, we conducted a continuous 2-month measurement campaign with stateof-the-art instruments to elucidate the NPF and growth mechanisms in northern Italy.

In contrast, oxygenated organic molecules from the atmospheric oxidation of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) appear to play a minor role in the initial cluster formation but contribute significantly to the consecutive growth process.

Specifically with respect to the distinct features of the Po Valley compared with the more intensely researched megacity environments, a deeper understanding of frequent NPF events, including their precursors, nucleation mechanisms and growth processes, is crucial for air pollution control and the effective implementation of  $PM_{2.5}$  mitigation measures in such a semi-urban but highly industrialized region. In this study, we conducted a 2-month field campaign in the months of March and April 2022. During this field campaign, we  $(1)$  identified the chemical composition of atmospheric neutral and ion clusters using a set of state-ofthe-art mass spectrometers,  $(2)$  characterized the initial NPF and further growth rates using particle number size distribution measurements down to  $1 \\text{ nm}$ , and (3) compared the field measurement results with the recent Cosmics Leaving Outdoor Droplets (CLOUD) chamber experiments to investigate the mechanism of NPF events in the Po Valley region. This allowed us to elucidate the NPF and growth mechanisms at a polluted southern European site and to give insights into the best mitigation strategies for ultrafine particle pollution in the context of already implemented  $PM_{2.5}$  reduction strategies.",

According to a previous study (Yan et al., 2021), the source and sink terms of the SA dimer can be determined by calculating the formation rate from SA monomer collisions and the loss rate from the SA dimer through coagulation onto pre-existing particles (Fig. 2b). In general, the correlation coefficient between the SA dimer and its source to sink term ratios ( $r = 0.80$ , Spearman correlation coefficient) indicated that, similar to Chinese urban areas, the SA dimer was in a pseudo-steady state between the formation of SA monomer collision and the loss onto the CS by coagulation.",

The growth rates observed here were similar to those observed by Kontkanen et al. (2016) at SPC in summer (7.2 nm  $h^{-1}$  for 7\u201320 nm). Moreover, our 1.5\u2013 3 nm growth rate matches well with Manninen et al. (2010)  $(1.5 \\text{ nm h}^{-1})$  during spring in the Po Valley. A comparison to predicted growth rates from sulfuric acid condensation without organics, which was calculated based on kinetic collisions of the measured SA concentrations and the effect of van der Waals forces on the collision frequency (Stolzenburg et al., 2020), suggests that sulfuric acid condensation may be, on average, sufficient for the growth of the smallest clusters (Fig. 3c). This supports the argument that sulfuric acid and its stabilizing molecules (likely the bases, such as  $NH_3$  and amines) were controlling particle formation in the initial steps of NPF and growth in the Po Valley. However, for particles to grow beyond 3 nm in size, other vapors were needed, which was suggested by the significantly lower contribution of growth by SA (indicated by the green line) than the measured GR for  $3-7$  and  $7-15$  nm particles (Fig. 3c). Those vapors were likely a mixture of organics from anthropogenic and biogenic origins (with the latter emitted at higher rates during summer). We compared the GR during NPF with and without growth events using the method proposed in Kulmala et al.  $(2022)$ : the signal was averaged for all classified non-event days and an appearance time fit was then performed for each size channel independently, also revealing a growth pattern. We found no significant difference with respect to the GR in the  $7-15 \\text{ nm}$  size range for NPF with or without growth days ( $\\text{GR} = 5.1 \\text{ nm h}^{-1}$  for NPF with growth days and  $GR = 6.1 \\text{ nm h}^{-1}$  for NPF without growth days). Considering the similar CS and GR levels for NPF with and without growth days, the higher formation rates at  $1.7 \\text{ nm}$  ( $87 \\text{ cm}^{-3} \\text{ s}^{-1}$ ) may be a more important factor to surpass the CS. Under stable meteorological conditions, a higher formation rate may significantly elevate the possibility that newly formed particles overcome the CS and continuously grow to larger sizes.",

Through direct ion cluster measurement, kinetic models and comparison with the CLOUD chamber experiment, we have determined that sulfuric acid\u2013base nucleation is the dominant formation mechanism in the Po Valley region. Abundant sulfuric acid and alkaline molecules, including amines and ammonia derived from agriculture activities, provided ample precursors for NPF events. In contrast to megacity environments, the CS showed no significant difference between NPF event days and non-event days, indicating that it is more the abundance of precursors than the variations in the sink controlling the occurrence of NPF in the Po Valley. Furthermore, we observed that, apart from DMA, a typical basic precursor, NH<sup>3</sup> and other amines were also likely to be involved in NPF in the Po Valley. This was supported by the high abundance of SA\u2013NH<sup>3</sup> and SA\u2013NH3\u2013amine clusters measured by the APi-ToF during NPF events. DMA, while more efficient than ammonia, was insufficient to stabilize all SA during our sampling period. This resulted in a more scattered correlation between sulfuric acid concentrations and measured formation rates compared with Chinese megacities. In that sense, we could show that the clustering during NPF is clearly distinct between polluted megacity environments and polluted semi-urbanized regions such as the Po Valley. Similar to Beijing, we found that OOMs did not play a decisive role in initial cluster formation, likely due to the absence of ultra-low-volatility organics (typical OOM dimers) in the ion and neutral cluster measurements. However, low-volatility organics were abundant enough to induce fast growth processes above 3 nm. The comparable GRs and formation rates, along with the lower efficient CS compared with megacity environments, indicate a high survival probability for the newly formed particles. Therefore, NPF is likely to play an important role in the fine-particle concentrations and pollution levels in the Po Valley region. Further reductions in key NPF species, including SO2, amines and NH3, can contribute to suppressing the NPF event frequency and lowering particle numbers. This, in turn, would improve air quality in the Po Valley region.",

Similar to Beijing, we found that OOMs did not play a decisive role in initial cluster formation, likely due to the absence of ultra-low-volatility organics (typical OOM dimers) in the ion and neutral cluster measurements. However, low-volatility organics were abundant enough to induce fast growth processes above 3 nm. The comparable GRs and formation rates, along with the lower efficient CS compared with megacity environments, indicate a high survival probability for the newly formed particles. Therefore, NPF is likely to play an important role in the fine-particle concentrations and pollution levels in the Po Valley region. Further reductions in key NPF species, including SO2, amines and NH3, can contribute to suppressing the NPF event frequency and lowering particle numbers.

For example, nitroaromatic compounds (Laskin et al., 2015; Xie et al., 2017) and imidazole-like species (Bones et al., 2010; Li et al., 2019) are typical brown carbon molecules that absorb solar radiation, leading to a warming effect. Amines are more efficient than ammonia (NH3) in reacting with sulfuric acid to form new particles (Qiu et al., 2011), even in urban regions with high aerosol loading (Yao et al., 2018). Nitro-polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (nitro-PAHs) are known toxicants to the human body (Miller-Schulze et al., 2010; Bandowe and Meusel, 2017). Additionally, the atmospheric deposition of organic nitrogen (ON) species serves as a significant source of N nutrient for marine and remote continental regions (Kielland et al., 2006; Andersen et al., 2017; Li et al., 2023).

Among the primary sources, coal combustion and vehicle emissions were the most dominant, each contributing 21 % to the aerosol ON. This finding was consistent with the summertime measurements at the same site that vehicle emissions and coal combustion dominated the primary emission sources of ON (Yu et al., 2023). The contribution of coal combustion to ON was higher during nighttime, whereas the contribution of vehicle emissions increased during traffic rush hours (Fig. 2c). In comparison, industrial and dust emissions had relatively lower contributions to ON but showed increased contributions during daytime. Biomass burning has been recognized as an important source of aerosol ON (Mace et al., 2003; Chen and Chen, 2010; Yu et al., 2017). In this study, we found that a negligible fraction of ON was apportioned to the primary biomass burning factor while a notable presence (7.2 %) of ON in the factor of nitrocatechol formation processes (Fig. 2). Nitrocatechols are probably formed through the nitration of catechols emitted from biomass burning. This secondary formation pathway was supported by the good correlation between levoglucosan and nitrocatechols (Fig. S7). The contribution of primary cooking emissions to ON was generally low, averaging 2 % across the observation period. However, this contribution increased to 5 \u00b1 4 % (ranging from 0.8 % to 17 %) during dinner time (Fig. 2).",

This fraction of SON may indicate the formation of organic nitrates, which share common precursor of  $NO_x$  with nitrate. Organic nitrates have long been recognized as notable components of secondary OAs in ambient air (Rollins et al., 2012; Perring et al., 2013). Organic nitrate formation encompasses two main pathways: hydroxyl radical (OH)-initiated oxidation of hydrocarbons in the presence of  $NO_x$  during the day and nitrate radical ( $NO_3$ )-initiated oxidation of alkenes during the night. Both pathways involve the formation of organic nitrates in the gas phase, followed by partitioning to the particulate phase (Perring et al., 2013). This study, through integrated analyses of SON and SOC, provides evidence suggesting that organic nitrates might also form through heterogeneous or aqueous reactions. As depicted in Fig. 4, the nitrate formation process produced  $0.17 \\,\\mu\\text{g N m}^{-3}$  of  $\\Delta\\text{SON}$  and  $0.43 \\,\\mu\\text{g C m}^{-3}$  of  $\\Delta\\text{SOC}$  from the night of 20 December to the following morning, yielding a  $\\Delta$ SOC /  $\\Delta$ SON atomic ratio of only 2.9. Gas-phase formation of organic nitrates followed by gas-to-particle partitioning would not result in such a low  $C/N$  ratio. Therefore, a large number of organic nitrates might be formed through heterogeneous or aqueous reactions between organic compounds and  $\\text{HNO}_3 / \\text{NO}_3$ , enhancing the ON content while not affecting the OC content which is already present in the particle phase. In a previous study, it was suggested that organic nitrates can be produced through non-radical reactions of hydrated glyoxal and nitric acid in the aqueous phase (Lim et al., 2016). Xu et al.

Organic nitrates have long been recognized as notable components of secondary OAs in ambient air (Rollins et al., 2012; Perring et al., 2013). Organic nitrate formation encompasses two main pathways: hydroxyl radical (OH)-initiated oxidation of hydrocarbons in the presence of  $NO_x$  during the day and nitrate radical ( $NO_3$ )-initiated oxidation of alkenes during the night.

To find the causes of air pollution, the propagation processes of air pollutants must be studied at a large spatial scale. However, the complex and dynamic wind fields lead to highly uncertain pollutant transportation. The state-of-the-art data mining approaches cannot fully support the extensive analysis of such uncertain spatiotemporal propagation processes across multiple districts without the integration of domain knowledge. The limitation of these automated approaches motivates us to design and develop AirVis, a novel visual analytics system that assists domain experts in efficiently capturing and interpreting the uncertain propagation patterns of air pollution based on graph visualizations. Designing such a system poses three challenges: a) the extraction of propagation patterns; b) the scalability of pattern presentations; and c) the analysis of propagation processes. To address these challenges, we develop a novel pattern mining framework to model pollutant transportation and extract frequent propagation patterns efficiently from large-scale atmospheric data. Furthermore, we organize the extracted patterns hierarchically based on the minimum description length (MDL) principle and empower expert users to explore and analyze these patterns effectively on the basis of pattern topologies. We demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach through two case studies conducted with a real-world dataset and positive feedback from domain experts.",

Moreover, the probabilistic cause-effect relationship between the districts can be encoded on the node-link diagram to help users interpret the pattern of interest.",

Moreover, the pie charts in Fig. [1C](#page-0-0)5 and [1C](#page-0-0)6 indicated that the pollution propagated along two different paths was largely contributed by the pollution in these two districts, which were constantly exposed to the pollution from Shijiazhuang.
