Such causal relations can reveal the latent temporal interactions between the sensors where the urban time series are collected, facilitating the effective sense- making of urban phenomena and the informed policy- making for better sustainability [86]. For example, if the pollutant readings at sensors  $A$  and  $B$  are identified to cause a considerable increase in those at sensor  $C$  consistently, proper measures should be taken to control the pollution at  $A$  and  $B$  rather than  $C$ ."

    "paragraph_info": "Many efforts have been devoted to the efficient extraction and extensive analysis of the co- occurrence [15, 36, 75] and correlation relations [45, 63] among urban time series or events. However, the patterns and insights derived in these studies do not imply true causality, and thus the reliability of the results is often limited in applications. Recent studies [38, 89] have investigated applying the Granger causality test to capture the causal relations among urban time series. Based on a set of urban time series, these studies attempt to extract a causal graph, where each cause- effect relation between a pair of sensors is represented with a directed edge. However, one causal graph is insufficient to characterize the dynamic causal relations among multiple urban time series due to the rapidly- changing urban environments. For example, a causal relation between two sensors detected based on their time series can disappear or even be flipped from time to time (Fig. 2a) because of certain external factors, such as the wind fields in the air pollution scenarios. Such a dynamic nature demands fine- grained causality analyses that enable analysts to gain insights into the temporal variations of causal relations in urban contexts. In addition to the limitation of granularity in the prior studies, interpreting and validating these causal relations detected by automated models also require an interactive system to integrate analysts in the urban causality analysis loop [76]."

Based on the requirements, we further develop Compass, a visual analytics system for the causal analysis of urban time series. Compass addresses the aforementioned three challenges as follows. For the first challenge, we propose a causal detection framework by extending the Granger causality test. This framework includes neighbor index, time partition, and debounce strategies to improve the capability of the causality test for urban time series. For the second challenge, we design a dynamic graph visualization to reveal the temporal variation of the detected causal relations and enable time- oriented drill- down analyses of causal graphs. For the third challenge, we consider the multiple dimensions of causal relations and propose a tailored visualization to expose causality suspiciousness. Finally, two real- world case studies on air pollution and traffic speed datasets, respectively, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. In sum, our contributions are as follows:"

Various visualizations have been proposed for this kind of data. Such as dimension reduction [68,88], scatterplot matrix [49], parallel coordinate plot (PCP) [10] and glyphs [82]. This view should satisfy two requirements, showing details and revealing suspiciousness. We have created two alternatives after exploring the design space. The first one is the spreadsheet that is commonly seen as a detail view (Fig. 7b- 1). However, it cannot handle many relations. The second one is the PCP (Fig. 7b- 2) better than the spreadsheet. Numerous causal relations can be displayed. The values of each dimension can be seen in the parallel axes. The first type of suspicious relations can be indicated by the gray lines passing the top of the distance axis (Fig. 7b- 2). Built on the PCP, we adopt scatterplots to visualize the dimensions related to the same causal direction (Fig. 6d). Scatterplots allow another suspiciousness metric, the Pearson's  $r$ , to be encoded using the size that can be accurately perceived. Besides, scatterplots are more familiar to the experts than the PCP."

This study compared the optimization effects of these two methods and developed a new scheme that combines DA and BC simultaneously. Four parallel experiments were conducted during winter 2019: a control experiment directly forecasted by WRF- Chem (experiment name: WRF- Chem); an experiment that assimilated in situ observations based on the GSI (Gridpoint Statistical Interpolation) system (WRF- Chem_DA); an experiment with deep- learning- based BC (WRF- Chem_BC); and an experiment considering the combination of DA on the initial conditions and BC (WRF- Chem_DA_BC). Statistically, the accuracy of  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  predictions could be optimized by both DA and BC for the first 24- h period, and WRF- Chem_BC performed better than WRF- Chem_DA in the initial field, especially in the period of 10–24 h, while the best performance was achieved by combining BC and DA. Throughout the initial 24- h period, compared with the control experiment, the results of WRF- Chem_DA_BC (WRF- Chem_DA, WRF- Chem_BC) showed an improvement in terms of root- mean- square error, with reduction proportions varying from 38.90% to 48.86% (18.88% to 32.44%, 30.10% to 46.08%). Besides having the best optimization effect over the whole domain, the combined method also performed well in different regions: during the forecasting period of 0–24 h, the RMSEs decreased from 32% to 62%, 39% to 57%, 28% to 40%, and 30% to 49% in the Beijing- Tianjin- Hebei, Yangtze River Delta, Central China, and Sichuan Basin urban agglomerations, respectively."

(2012) used three different assimilation methods with MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) AOD (aerosol optical depth) products and in situ  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  observations, and the results showed that all three methods improved the forecasting of aerosols. Song et al. (2021) used the 3DVAR (three- dimensional variational) approach to jointly assimilate meteorological data and in situ observations to improve the prediction of  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$ . Hong et al. (2022) assimilated in situ observations and satellite data simultaneously to further improve  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  predictions. And in another study, different kinds of data were used in the assimilation of the initial field to analyze the enhancement of  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  forecasts by different assimilation sources (Ma et al., 2024). These previous studies have shown that DA can improve  $\\mathrm{PM}_{2.5}$  predictions by adjusting the initial state of the atmospheric chemistry, but the improvement of the prediction is limited, and the effect of assimilation gradually disappears with long- term integration of the simulation (Ma et al., 2024; Ma et al., 2020; Hong et al., 2022). In addition, the model prediction errors are not only affected by the uncertainty of the initial field, but also various other uncertainties such as those of the meteorological field and the physicochemical reactions (Zhu et al., 2018). Numerical model BC comprehensively considers the systematic errors of the model forecast to improve the forecast accuracy. Different from DA, which is the adjustment of the initial field from the model input perspective, BC is the post- processing of model outputs from the back end of the model, and can to a certain extent make up for the limitations of initial field DA."

    "paragraph_info": "BC is a statistical method that improves model predictions by establishing a relationship between historical observations and the corresponding model forecasts, from which the forecast bias can be extracted and the systematic errors corrected. With the advancements made in this line of research, BC methods have been developed from the earlier complete forecast method (Klein et al., 1959) to the model output statistical method (Glahn and Lowry, 1972), and then gradually evolved into different BC schemes. Frequency matching, Bayesian averaging, least- squares regression, multiple linear regression, and other statistical methods have been used to establish BC models, which significantly reduce systematic errors by learning the empirical relationships between historical forecasts and observations to realize BC (Raftery et al., 2005; Zhu and Luo, 2015; Xie et al., 2012; Chen et al., 2012; You, 2014). Recently, artificial- intelligence machine- learning techniques have emerged. Subsequently, BC based on machine- learning methods has been shown to better express the auxiliary links between various facets of the atmosphere, including, for instance, the different elements involved in atmospheric chemistry and key basic meteorological variables such as temperature and winds (Marzban, 2003; Zhang et al., 2022). Machine- learning models have been used in the BC of model outputs to improve  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  forecasts. For example, Ran et al. (2023) performed BC based on a multiple linear regression modeling approach to reduce the global  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  prediction bias; and Liu and Xing (2022a), Liu and Xing (2022b) designed a fully connected deep neural network to correct the  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  concentration bias in the outputs of chemical models, achieving better results than without the correction method applied. Ma et al. (2020) applied a time series model to correct  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  forecasts, which achieved good results. Different machine- learning methods were utilized by Li et al. (2021) as bias adjustment for postprocessing forecasts of  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  and  $\\mathrm{O}_3$ , showing the optimal approach to be the Random Forest model. Lu et al. (2020) utilized machine- learning methods to improve the accuracy of  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  forecasts through WRF- Chem in the Chengdu- Chongqing region. Overall, machine- learning methods have shown strong advantages in mining nonlinear relationships, enabling them to perform well in the BC of numerical predictions. However, they usually require massive, multi- source data inputs, which can limit their applicability in specific scenarios."

MDS- UNet shows advantages in multiscale feature learning due to its multiscale convolution module, as compared with the traditional UNet. The single convolution kernel in the traditional model can only catch some of the features of the pollutants with a fixed scale. However, pollution characteristics vary on different spatial scales and multiscale convolution adopts a hierarchical structure with different spatial sizes of convolution kernels to extract the multiscale features by learning feature maps from the image. By merging feature maps of different scale, not only the pollutant concentration values, but also the spatial information on pollutant distributions, can then be obtained. The model has three advantages: acquisition of multiscale information, acquiring surrounding spatial information, and reducing information loss."

Fig. 3 shows the spatial performances of  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  prediction RMSEs averaged in winter produced by the different experiments.

By comparing Fig. 3a, 3b and 3c, it can be seen that both DA and BC were able to reduce the  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  prediction RMSE, despite different performances over different regions.

As can be seen, WRF- Chem overestimated the  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  concentrations over some areas of SCB, CC, and YRD, with the prediction MB values reaching  $60\\mu \\mathrm{g} / \\mathrm{m}^3$  in some areas. A reason for this might be that the emissions inventory overestimated the winter emissions in the above regions and the model simulation was relatively more uncertain due to the complex terrain (Wei et al., 2022). In contrast, the  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  concentrations were underestimated in BTH, with the prediction MB ranging from  $- 60$  to  $- 20\\mu \\mathrm{g} / \\mathrm{m}^3$ . This performance whereby WRF- Chem always underestimates  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  concentrations over northern areas in China is a common problem, caused by not simulating secondary aerosols or the transformation mechanisms with their gaseous precursors (Ma, 2020; Wei et al., 2022; Qin et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2016). The prediction MB values were reduced by the DA and BC methods, but BC had better effects in terms of prediction improvement. Consistent with the results shown in Fig. 3, despite the adjustment to the original overestimation by DA in WRF- Chem_DA over some regions of SCB and CC, the prediction MB values could still reach  $60\\mu \\mathrm{g} / \\mathrm{m}^3$  in some areas, thus demonstrating some advantages of DA, but with limitations. Compared with the direct predictions of WRF- Chem, the prediction MB values in the WRF- Chem_BC experiment were reduced over most areas due to BC effects. It is worth noting that the original overestimation changed to an underestimation in the WRF- Chem_BC experiment over some regions of YRD and the Shandong Peninsula, which indicated overcorrection by BC. For WRF- Chem_DA_BC, the prediction MB was the smallest among all the experiments, with values less than  $20\\mu \\mathrm{g} / \\mathrm{m}^3$  over most areas. WRF- Chem_DA_BC showed a smaller prediction MB than WRF- Chem_BC, especially over the Shandong Peninsula and YRD regions."

From the scatter fitting analysis results, WRF- Chem_DA_BC performed best in its consistency with observations following optimization. The results predicted directly by WRF- Chem in the control experiment were dispersed, with some isolated overestimation and underestimation scatter points fitted along the slope of 0.56, which demonstrates poor ability in simulating the high- pollution zones. By applying DA, the predictions of WRF- Chem_DA were partially improved, with an increased fitting slope of 0.69, showing less overestimation and underestimation through the adjustment of the initial field. The optimization of WRF- Chem_BC was much more evident than that of WRF- Chem_DA compared with the control experiment since the overestimation of the model was adjusted and the overall scatter distributions were more concentrated. However, there still existed an overall underestimation trend, with a slope of 0.73 after BC, which may not be sufficient for the simulation of strong pollution processes. It can be seen from Fig. 6a and 6d that the results of WRF- Chem_DA_BC were greatly improved by combining the two optimization methods, with the fitted slope of 1.04 being close to the straight line of  $k = 1$ . In this experiment, the  $\\mathrm{PM}{2.5}$  predictions were well adjusted and almost all of the high pollution could be captured, showing the best agreement with the observations.

Assessments of these impacts rely heavily on the modeled aerosol absorption from poorly constrained global models and thus exhibit large uncertainties. By combining the AeroCom model ensemble with satellite and in situ observations, we provide constraints on the aerosol absorption optical depth (AAOD) over the Amazon and Africa. Our approach enables identification of error contributions from emission, lifetime, and MAC (mass absorption coefficient) per model, with MAC and emission dominating the AAOD errors over Amazon and Africa, respectively. In addition to primary emissions, our analysis suggests substantial formation of secondary organic aerosols over the Amazon but not over Africa. Furthermore, we find that differences in direct aerosol radiative effects between models decrease by threefold over the BB source and outflow regions after correcting the identified errors. This highlights the potential to greatly reduce the uncertainty in the most uncertain radiative forcing agent."

    "paragraph_info": "Despite the recent progress in airborne measurements of BBA, large- scale and long- term assessments of the climate impacts of BBA have far relied on global aerosol models (14, 15). However, models have shown substantial discrepancies and errors regarding BBA absorption (16- 19), which remains a key obstacle to reliable climate assessments because BBA absorption can simultaneously contribute to direct, semidirect, and indirect aerosol effects (9, 20). Comparisons between models and satellite observations suggest that global models generally underestimate the overall warming impacts of BBA, as indicated by a substantial underestimation of the aerosol absorption optical depth (AAOD) (21) in combination with an overestimation of the single- scattering albedo (SSA) (20). These findings are supported by flight campaign measurements (22, 23) such as the ObseRvations of Aerosols above CLOUDs and their intEractionS (ORACLES) project (22), suggesting that the overall warming caused by BBA plumes is greater than previously considered, particularly in tropical regions. However, when considering the aerosol composition, global models tend to produce stronger absorption than observed from field and laboratory measurements for a given BC mass mixing ratio (24). The contradiction between the underestimated overall warming and overestimated absorbing capability per unit of BC mass highlights important errors in the emission, composition, and optical properties of absorbing BBA. Although there have been discussions regarding the possible reasons for these model errors [e.g., particle size distribution, vertical profiles, mixing states, and refractive index (24- 28)], a quantitative evaluation of how these factors contribute to the overall errors is still missing. This poses a fundamental challenge to the aerosol modeling community, which hinders reliable climate assessments over tropical regions."

It is similar to the methodology applied in a previous study (31), in which we analyze AOD and considered all aerosols instead of carbonaceous aerosols only. Briefly, we linearly regressed modeled MAC against modeled SSA and modeled  $\\tau$  against modeled precipitation and the angstrom exponent (AE; an indicator of ambient particle size) using the model data from the AeroCom (Aerosol Comparisons between Observations and Models; see table S1) project. Then, we applied satellite observations of SSA to estimate the constrained MAC and similarly constrain  $\\tau$  from observations of precipitation and AE. Last, we used Eq. 1 to constrain  $E$  The constrained values of  $E,\\tau ,$  and MAC allow us to attribute AAOD errors to contributions from these three factors for individual models. Uncertainty analysis is conducted for all these constraining processes as shown in Fig. 1. Notably, the constrained results are only effective on a regional and seasonal scale, and caution must be exercised when directly applying these results to smaller scales. This work presents advancements upon the foundation of (31) as it constrains MAC instead of MEC (mass extinction coefficient). In addition, we implement in situ data in the interpretation of satellite observations that allows a disaggregation of BC and OC emissions. Furthermore, in our seasonal, regional analysis, we find that SOA formation is important for fire aerosols over the Amazon but not over Africa."

To achieve this goal, we use the linear relationship observed by (24) between rBC and SSA to estimate ambient rBC from satellite observations of SSA. AeroCom models allow us to establish a relationship between ambient and emitted rBC, which, in any case, is close to identical (see Materials and Methods). These constrained BC and OA emissions can be compared with four widely used inventories of BC and OC emissions [i.e., Global Fire Emission Database version 4.1s (GFED), Global Fire Assimilation System version 1.2 (GFAS), Fire Energetics and Emission Research version 1.2 (FEER), and Quick Fire Emissions Dataset version 2.5 (QFED)], providing that we have reasonable OA/OC ratios (Fig. 4). Field measurements of primary BBA emissions exhibit a narrow range (1.5 to 1.9) for OA/OC (33- 39).

However, the BC inventory emissions are generally higher (except in the GFAS inventory), which is consistent with the overestimated MAC in models (Fig. 3A).

S17). The raw POLDER- GRASP data are then applied to the regression to estimate the regional AAOD. A similar method is also used to estimate the regional SSA. The robustness of the method is verified through a jackknife test by removing the models one by one, which produces small relative variations in the predicted regional AAOD and SSA (<1%), suggesting that the construction of regional values is independent of the models used. The regional observations of AAOD and SSA are also used to validate the models on a seasonal scale (see fig. S18), showing a varying degree of error per model. Broadly, models tend to underestimate SSA over the Amazon (by 0.05 on average) and underestimate AAOD over Southern Africa (by 32% on average)."

All the variables are calculated as regional fire- season averages.

In addition, we find a small absorption AE from POLDER- GRASP observations (fig. S19), suggesting that brown carbon is not important (51, 52).

It should be noted that the relationship by (24) was established under the criteria that OA and BC accounted for more than  $85\\%$  of the total aerosol mass (to focus on BBAs). For the AeroCom models, we compare the SSA for total aerosols and the SSA of grid cells with  $\\geq 85\\%$  carbonaceous aerosol components, with small differences being found for most models, especially within the range of the SSA observations (see fig.

At the first level, we revise the Storyline with new interactions and visual encodings, and link it with a geographic map, to present evolution patterns from a high level of perspective. At the second level, we employ an EvoLens, a lens placed on the Storyline, to display more details regarding the temporal trends of evolution patterns in a narrative- preserving manner. The map is coordinated with the EvoLens to provide the detailed spatial context of evolution patterns. GeoChron is comprehensively evaluated by a series of studies and analyses.

However, correlated ST series are sometimes not necessarily similar by values (e.g., Fig. 6E) but should have similar trends. To reveal their correlative trends, we design a trend motif (Fig. 6F). We denote the subpart of an ST series in a line chart as a sub- ST series. For a line chart, we respectively normalize each sub- ST series there according to its max and min values. For each time stamp in the line chart, we have a set of values, each of which is from a normalized sub- ST series. Afterward, we obtain the lower quartile  $q_{n}(0.25)$ , median, and upper quartile  $q_{n}(0.75)$  for these values. Finally, the lower and upper quartiles in all time stamps are visualized with an area. The medians in all time stamps form a median line. The line is superimposed with the area, constituting a trend motif. Via the trend motif, the correlative trends of multiple ST series can be revealed in circumstances where the ST series are dissimilar in values from each other. For example, the trend motif of Fig. 6F clearly shows an upward trend of the ST series in Fig. 6E."

Moreover, some aligned sessions are meant to be visually continuous, but this continuity is broken by these curves (e.g., Fig. 9B). Smaller the  $th_w$ , the less clutter. Second, we directly use the correlation coefficients in time slices rather than sliding windows and generate the layout in Fig. 9C with the same parameters in the first case ( $th_s = 7$  and  $th_c = 3$ ). We remove the gradient shade and focus on the layout. Compared with the time window- based results in Fig. 5D, the correlation relationship between ST series is more dynamic. In particular, the dashed ellipses in Fig. 9D and E highlight the unexpected deviation of curves. Entities part suddenly and come back together again, which may be due to the slightly offset time slices, subtle pollution events, or errors. Such deviations lead to visual clusters and prevent users from locating prominent visual patterns. It can be concluded that the sliding window does improve the readability of representations."

Due to the limited number of sensors and their limited monitoring capabilities, the recorded ST series of these phenomena exhibit discreteness in the time and space domains. Targeting such a kind of ST series, we propose VolumeSTCube towards better visualization of large- scale ST series. It first transforms the discrete ST series data into continuous space- time volumetric data following the strategy of the space- time cube. Afterward, the volume- based visualization is designed and then equipped with a set of flexible interactions. The combination of the space- time cube and 3D volume visualization effectively presents large- scale ST series with less context switching cost and visual occlusion."
