During sessions, experts reviewed representative circular visualizations extracted from the 42 papers, provided feedback through scenario walkthroughs, and engaged in feature prioritization and mockup evaluations.

Circos is capable of displaying data as scatter, line, and histogram plots, heat maps, tiles, connectors, and text.

We need to establish a visual paradigm for displaying relationships between genomes in order to leverage the large amounts of sequence data that have been collected and to expand the power of the field of personal genomics. Previous efforts to visualize positional relationships applied linearly arranged ideograms, connected by lines, to represent rearrangements (Dicks 2000; Kozik et al. 2002; Yang et al. 2003; Choudhuri et al. 2004; Engels et al. 2006; Lee et al. 2006; Jakubowska et al. 2007; Kuenne et al. 2007; Sinha and Meller 2007). One approach uses encoding in HSL (hue, saturation, lightness) color space to perform three-way comparisons (Baran et al. 2007). The methods embodied in these approaches are effective for illustrating local alignments between similar sequences. However, the shortcoming of the linear layout becomes apparent in representations that associate many ideograms with numerous relationships (e.g., Fig. 2c in Lee et al. 2006). In such figures, multitudes of lines transgress unrelated ideograms and make patterns very difficult to discern. To mitigate this, color maps are used (e.g., Fig. 2 in Sinha and Meller 2007) as an effective way to represent large syntenic blocks. Although color maps address the problem of overburdened visualizations by mapping a position pair onto a position and a color, they reduce the texture and richness of the data. Circularly arranged ideograms are prevalent in visualizations of microbial genomes, which are circular (Gibson and Smith 2003; Sato and Ehira 2003; Kerkhoven et al. 2004; Stothard and Wishart 2005;"

One approach uses encoding in HSL (hue, saturation, lightness) color space to perform three-way comparisons (Baran et al. 2007). The methods embodied in these approaches are effective for illustrating local alignments between similar sequences. However, the shortcoming of the linear layout becomes apparent in representations that associate many ideograms with numerous relationships (e.g., Fig. 2c in Lee et al. 2006). In such figures, multitudes of lines transgress unrelated ideograms and make patterns very difficult to discern. To mitigate this, color maps are used (e.g., Fig. 2 in Sinha and Meller 2007) as an effective way to represent large syntenic blocks. Although color maps address the problem of overburdened visualizations by mapping a position pair onto a position and a color, they reduce the texture and richness of the data. Circularly arranged ideograms are prevalent in visualizations of microbial genomes, which are circular (Gibson and Smith 2003; Sato and Ehira 2003; Kerkhoven et al. 2004; Stothard and Wishart 2005;"

Specifically, to address the issue of sparseness, the scale on each ideogram can be independently adjusted (both locally and globally) to attenuate or increase the visibility of a region. To accommodate visualizations that focus on regions of interest, axis breaks can be used to map chromosomes onto any number of ideograms, which themselves can be drawn in any order or orientation. To help demonstrate patterns in the data, data points can have their value and format characteristics altered by flexible rules. Finally, to help integrate Circos into analysis pipelines, image creation is controlled by flat-text configuration files, which can be created and adjusted automatically."

This data set comprises about 2.16 million gapped alignments between the two assemblies. Alignment bundles were built up from individual alignments by a scheme (implemented by bundlelinks, a utility tool in the circostools distribution) that grouped alignments into sets. For a given alignment set, (1) all alignments related the same pair of dog and human chromosomes, (2) any alignment was no further than 250 kb away from its nearest neighbor in the set, and (3) the number of alignments in the set was at least three. Each set is represented in Figure 8 as a ribbon whose ends represent the extent of the set alignments on the dog and human chromosomes.

Bioinformatics analysts typically use visualizations to analyze genomics data and gain valuable insights [NHG19, O'D21]. Among various visualization techniques, circos plots [Krz09] are widely used for visualizing genomics data [OBC*18], which present gene data in various formats (e.g., line, histogram) using multiple nested concentric circles arranged around the circumference of the same gene sequence. Circos plots allow for a compact display of analysis results from multiple dimensions and facilitate multiple downstream tasks (e.g., comparative analysis, correlation analysis) within a single visual space."

Poppler's paragraph grouping mechanism [Tea18] was then applied to match annotations with illustrations, resulting in 29,701 matched pairs with metadata such as paper source, page number, and position. To isolate circos plot illustrations, we trained a binary classification deep learning model using ResNet50 [KK21] fine-tuned with pre-trained weights from ImageNET1K_V2 [DDS*09]. Positive samples were sourced from the Circos [Krz09] website and image searches on Google and Bing, while negative samples came from VIS30K [CLL*21]. All images were in PNG (Portable Network Graphics) format and resized to  $224*224$  pixels as input. The dataset was split into  $80\\%$  for training and  $20\\%$  for testing. After training for 5 epochs, the model achieved  $99.23\\%$  accuracy on the test set. Using this model, we extracted 4,531 illustration-annotation pairs.

This is likely because ideograms, which display chromosomes and bands, enhance the interpretability of gene regions highlighted in the data. Additionally, histogram and line are often paired with themselves to present multiple data attributes, likely due to their ability to use colors to distinguish different attributes, making them ideal for visualizing complex datasets."

Similarly, it converts each annotation and its corresponding configuration in the dataset into vectors within the same semantic space. Then, we use Chroma [Tea22] to build the vector database, which stores annotation-configuration vectors generated by the text embedding model, providing external knowledge for the subsequent generator. The vector converted from the user's query is compared with vectors stored in the database using Euclidean Distance, and the top 10 most relevant vectors are selected as examples, where the number of examples can be adjusted by users. Since both the annotations and the query are embedded in the same semantic space, the similarity between vectors reflects their semantic similarity."

However, the evaluation process could be improved from several perspectives. First, while we assessed the usability and effectiveness of IntelliCircos's main features, we did not evaluate AI assistance in terms of trust and perceived cognitive load, which is an interesting part to dive deeper for empirical insights as suggested by [YWWW19, GKC*23]. Examining these aspects would offer additional insights into the tool's overall effectiveness. Second, this paper primarily focuses on the design and development of the tool, and as outlined in Section 8.1, we did not include a baseline comparison in our study. However, a thorough empirical investigation comparing different approaches (e.g., IntelliCircos and Circos software) could provide a broader understanding of their respective strengths and limitations. Third, the study's participant pool was limited. Future work should involve a larger and more diverse group, including those not experienced creators to better assess the tool's real-world value. Lastly, all questions in the questionnaire are positive. A better design approach would involve inverting the polarity of questions to validate participants' responses."
