    "paragraph_info": "Circular genome visualizations offer aesthetic appeal and spatial efficiency for representing long genomic sequences and their interconnections. Tools, such as Circos, have become standard for visualizing genomic alterations and chromosome structures in circular layout. However, they rely heavily on manual configuration and scripting, imposing steep learning curves and time-consuming workflows. Researchers often need to iteratively adjust parameters to fit data-specific requirements, which can impede productivity and limit the clarity or expressiveness of the final output. These limitations highlight the demand for intelligent, automated visualization solutions tailored to the unique characteristics of circular genomic data."

Circos uses a circular ideogram layout to facilitate the display of relationships between pairs of positions by the use of ribbons, which encode the position, size, and orientation of related genomic elements. Circos is capable of displaying data as scatter, line, and histogram plots, heat maps, tiles, connectors, and text.

We need to establish a visual paradigm for displaying relationships between genomes in order to leverage the large amounts of sequence data that have been collected and to expand the power of the field of personal genomics. Previous efforts to visualize positional relationships applied linearly arranged ideograms, connected by lines, to represent rearrangements (Dicks 2000; Kozik et al. 2002; Yang et al. 2003; Choudhuri et al. 2004; Engels et al. 2006; Lee et al. 2006; Jakubowska et al. 2007; Kuenne et al. 2007; Sinha and Meller 2007). One approach uses encoding in HSL (hue, saturation, lightness) color space to perform three-way comparisons (Baran et al. 2007). The methods embodied in these approaches are effective for illustrating local alignments between similar sequences. However, the shortcoming of the linear layout becomes apparent in representations that associate many ideograms with numerous relationships (e.g., Fig. 2c in Lee et al. 2006). In such figures, multitudes of lines transgress unrelated ideograms and make patterns very difficult to discern. To mitigate this, color maps are used (e.g., Fig. 2 in Sinha and Meller 2007) as an effective way to represent large syntenic blocks. Although color maps address the problem of overburdened visualizations by mapping a position pair onto a position and a color, they reduce the texture and richness of the data. Circularly arranged ideograms are prevalent in visualizations of microbial genomes, which are circular (Gibson and Smith 2003; Sato and Ehira 2003; Kerkhoven et al. 2004; Stothard and Wishart 2005;"

RAG consists of two stages: a retriever and a generator. The retriever takes the user's query and maps both the query and documents from an external corpus into a high-dimensional vector space using a shared embedding model. By calculating similarities (e.g., Euclidean distance) between the query vector and document vectors, it identifies the most relevant documents. The generator, often a pre-trained large language model (LLM), then uses the content of these retrieved documents to produce natural language text that satisfies both syntactic and semantic requirements. The prompt input to the generator is optimized through prompt engineering to guide the model in generating the most relevant output. Our recommendation framework is also divided into two stages based on RAG: the similar sample retriever and the configuration generator, as shown in Figure 4."

Similarly, it converts each annotation and its corresponding configuration in the dataset into vectors within the same semantic space. Then, we use Chroma [Tea22] to build the vector database, which stores annotation-configuration vectors generated by the text embedding model, providing external knowledge for the subsequent generator. The vector converted from the user's query is compared with vectors stored in the database using Euclidean Distance, and the top 10 most relevant vectors are selected as examples, where the number of examples can be adjusted by users.
