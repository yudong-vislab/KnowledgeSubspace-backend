Peng et al. $^{4}$  utilized circular layouts to depict plasmid structures carrying various genes, alongside sequence alignment results of other Enterobacteriaceae bacteria sharing similar plasmid backbones, thereby illustrating plasmid gene structures, multidrug resistance regions, and homology. Garcia et al. $^{5}$  in their study of the Lima bean genome, used circular layouts to display multiple features to understand genome organization and evolution.

Participants consistently highlighted the system's predefined interactive mechanisms—such as dynamic track reordering, attribute refinement, and visual reuse—as unexpectedly intuitive and powerful. These features not only facilitated iterative correction and fine-tuning, but also encouraged exploratory behavior, allowing users to experiment with alternative layout patterns, highlight strategies, or comparative track compositions.

We need to establish a visual paradigm for displaying relationships between genomes in order to leverage the large amounts of sequence data that have been collected and to expand the power of the field of personal genomics. Previous efforts to visualize positional relationships applied linearly arranged ideograms, connected by lines, to represent rearrangements (Dicks 2000; Kozik et al. 2002; Yang et al. 2003; Choudhuri et al. 2004; Engels et al. 2006; Lee et al. 2006; Jakubowska et al. 2007; Kuenne et al. 2007; Sinha and Meller 2007). One approach uses encoding in HSL (hue, saturation, lightness) color space to perform three-way comparisons (Baran et al. 2007). The methods embodied in these approaches are effective for illustrating local alignments between similar sequences. However, the shortcoming of the linear layout becomes apparent in representations that associate many ideograms with numerous relationships (e.g., Fig. 2c in Lee et al. 2006). In such figures, multitudes of lines transgress unrelated ideograms and make patterns very difficult to discern. To mitigate this, color maps are used (e.g., Fig. 2 in Sinha and Meller 2007) as an effective way to represent large syntenic blocks. Although color maps address the problem of overburdened visualizations by mapping a position pair onto a position and a color, they reduce the texture and richness of the data.

A BAC library was created from each tumor sample (average insert size of libraries ranged between 130 and  $200\\mathrm{kb}$ ) and subjected to restriction-digest fingerprinting (Marra et al. 1997; Schein et al. 2004; Mathewson et al. 2007) using an EcoRI/EcoRV double digest to a depth of fivefold to sixfold. Rearrangements (translocations, inversions, deletions) were identified from alignments of fingerprinted BACs onto the human reference sequence (Krzywinski et al. 2007). Copy number changes in the samples were identified using the Affymetrix Mapping 500K array. Individual BACs identified to capture rearrangements were subject to short-read Illumina sequencing and assembled with ABysS (Simpson et al. 2009)."

The position of a track is determined by its inner and outer radii: the inner radius refers to the distance from the inner side of the track to the circle's center, while the outer radius refers to the distance from the outer side of the track to the center. To enhance visual appeal or meet analytical needs, multiple tracks can be grouped within the same concentric rings, forming a structure we refer to as a ring. For example, in Figure 1 (A), there are three nested rings, where the ring Figure 1 (A1) is composed of a tile, and the ring Figure 1 (A2) is composed of two tracks: line and histogram. A circos plot typically consists of multiple concentric rings arranged around the same genomic axis. Angular ranges are used to encode the position coordinates of data across all tracks, effectively mapping data's location on the genomic axis. For example, Figure 1 (B) shows a circos plot with eight tracks, listed from outer to inner as follows Figure 1 (B1 - B8): ideogram, highlight, tile, scatter, line, heatmaps, histogram, and chord. Circos plots are widely used to demonstrate similarities or differences among diverse genomic features associated with the same genomic regions [WJT*23]. Furthermore, Circos [Krz09] is the most commonly used tool for creating circos plots."

Then, participants were asked to freely explore the system to familiarize themselves with the features (5 minutes). Next, they were asked to create a circos plot using IntelliCircos (25 minutes). After this, participants were asked to complete a 7-point Likert questionnaire in a think-aloud protocol, where users were encouraged to justify their ratings (5 minutes).

Users can express their design requirements in natural language, receiving AI-generated recommendations and similar design references. Participants in our study praised the tool in fostering creativity and inspiration, which is achieved by its AI recommendations and reference examples. These references not only guided their designs but also increased trust in the recommendations. This underscores the importance of transparency in AI assistance. In this regard, we believe embedding contextual information, such as provenance or real-world examples, can enhance user confidence in AI-driven tools. Furthermore, participants also appreciated the ability to combine AI recommendations with user-driven refinements, which allowed them to control the pace of design and implementation. This highlights the importance of enabling users to actively guide and refine AI outputs, rather than solely relying on automated suggestions."

The tool currently does not support sufficient data processing to prepare the data for circos plots, it only supports mapping the data to tracks. In the future, the tool can be enhanced to support data processing tasks, e.g., data filtering, so as to broaden the use cases of IntelliCircos. Currently, users need to modify relevant configurations one by one to adjust the chart to meet their needs, which is kind of cumbersome. In the future, IntelliCircos can be enhanced to recommend tailored configurations.
