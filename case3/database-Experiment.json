    "paragraph_info": "Circular genome visualizations are essential for exploring structural variants and gene regulation. However, existing tools often require complex scripting and manual configuration, making the process time-consuming, error-prone, and difficult to learn. To address these challenges, we introduce AuraGenome, a large language model (LLM)-powered framework for rapid, reusable, and scalable generation of multilayered circular genome visualizations. AuraGenome combines a semantic-driven multiagent workflow with an interactive visual analytics system. The workflow employs seven specialized LLM-driven agents, each assigned distinct roles, such as intent recognition, layout planning, and code generation, to transform raw genomic data into tailored visualizations. The system supports multiple coordinated views tailored for genomic data, offering ring, radial, and chord-based layouts to represent multilayered circular genome visualizations. In addition to enabling interactions and configuration reuse, the system supports real-time refinement and high-quality report export. We validate its effectiveness through two case studies and a comprehensive user study. AuraGenome is available at https://github.com/Darius18/AuraGenome."

Presented are structural data derived from primary tumor samples from five patients diagnosed with follicular lymphoma. For each sample, the figure shows large-scale rearrangements, density of small-scale events, and copy number profile (see Methods). For example, at  $130\\mathrm{Mb}$  on chromosome 1, each sample shows large deletions and inversions as well as translocations that involve chromosomes 4, 16, and 17. This region also marks the beginning of significantly increased copy number in three samples (middle three rings in track F) that continues to the end of the 1q arm."

Typically, analysts often seek inspiration from existing circos plots, and they have to iteratively adjust and refine the plot to achieve a satisfactory final design, making the process both tedious and time-intensive. To address these challenges, we propose IntelliCircos, an AI-powered interactive authoring tool that streamlines the process from initial visual design to the final implementation of circos plots. Specifically, we build a new dataset containing 4396 circos plots with corresponding annotations and configurations, which are extracted and labeled from published papers. With the dataset, we further identify track combination patterns, and utilize Large Language Model (LLM) to provide domain-specific design recommendations and configuration references to navigate the design of circos plots. We conduct a user study with 8 bioinformatics analysts to evaluate IntelliCircos, and the results demonstrate its usability and effectiveness in authoring circos plots."

Angular ranges are used to encode the position coordinates of data across all tracks, effectively mapping data's location on the genomic axis. For example, Figure 1 (B) shows a circos plot with eight tracks, listed from outer to inner as follows Figure 1 (B1 - B8): ideogram, highlight, tile, scatter, line, heatmaps, histogram, and chord. Circos plots are widely used to demonstrate similarities or differences among diverse genomic features associated with the same genomic regions [WJT*23]. Furthermore, Circos [Krz09] is the most commonly used tool for creating circos plots."

    "paragraph_info": "Streamlining the Creation Process from Design to Implementation. IntelliCircos simplifies the creation of circos plots by providing AI-generated recommendations and similar design references sourced from high-quality examples. The tool also automates the implementation of designs while offering customizable configuration options for fine-tuning the created visualization. One important lesson we learned was balancing simplicity and flexibility in the design-to-implementation workflow. Our findings revealed that most participants preferred the progressive recommendation approach over fully-automated suggestions or manual design, as it allowed them to iteratively refine the results to better align with their preferences. This highlights the importance of workflows that adapt to users' evolving needs. Natural language input further simplified the design process by allowing users to intuitively express their requirements. However, early testing revealed challenges in formulating complex prompts. To address this, we integrated predefined templates and auto-completion features, which were well-received by the participants. This underscores the value of intuitive UI enhancements in reducing the learning curve. While track-level configuration provides flexibility for customization, participants found it cumbersome when many adjustments were needed. A promising future direction is to enable users to select circos plots as references, allowing the tool to learn from these examples and recommend similar designs that better align with user preferences, thereby reducing the need for manual adjustments."
